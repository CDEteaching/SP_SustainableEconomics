    "text": "Preface\nVersion 1.0, October 2025\nThis e-learning course is intended for students to work through it at their own pace. There are no sessions held in presence. However, students can reach out to the lecturer for questions and support at any time via email. The course is structured along six sections that build on each other. Many sections are interactive and contain links and videos to consult. For more information on the course please see the information document of the course.\nThe course is divided into three blocks. In the introductory block, students are introduced to basic concepts and the theoretical assumptions of economics (Section 1-4). This is followed by a block on the problem analysis addressing the ecological, social, and economic challenges faced by the current economic and societal system (Section 5). In the final block, participants explore various building blocks that provide starting points for shaping a sustainable economy (Section 6-7).\nBelow you will find the contents of the course. Following the script will guide you through all the sections and learning material in a sensible order. Since this course requires a high degree of autonomy in acquiring the material, we also encourage you to contact us via email if you want to discuss questions (see information document).\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\n\nStudents can:\n\nunderstand that there are different theories in economics and are able to name them.\ncan identify the foundations of the emerging field of sustainable economics.\ncan distinguish between the problem analyses and solution approaches of sustainable economics and those of today’s dominant school of thought (neoclassical and environmental economics).\nare able to critically question both traditional and new economic approaches (concepts) and assess the conflicts inherent in them.\ncan reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical approaches, both in general and in relation to concrete problems.\ncan analyse how alternative economic models (e.g., circular economy, post-growth economics) function and evaluate their potential and limitations for economic policy.\nacquire basic knowledge about measures and transformation scenarios for implementing alternative economic models beyond the focus on maximizing profits and goods production.\n\n\n\nProcedure\nComplete the online course at your own pace. Once you feel prepared, you can complete the online exam.

    "text": "1.1 Sustainable development - Sustainability\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that disciplinary approaches and disciplinary specializations are often insufficient to understand and address the complex challenges and wicked problems of the 21st century. Sustainable development issues, in particular, extend across various scientific and thematic fields. This necessitates collaboration between disparate disciplines and other stakeholders. Thus, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are considered to be essential research approaches in the field of sustainability science.\nSustainability science can be understood as an arena where “contributions from the whole spectrum of the natural sciences, economics, and social sciences” (Martens 2006, 38) meet. Sustainability science distinguishes itself from “traditional” sciences, so-called mode-1 sciences (see Table 1.1), since it follows the normative ideas of sustainability.",

The following quote from Robert W. Kates captures appropriately the significance of sustainability science: “A new field of sustainability science is emerging that seeks to understand the fundamental character of interactions between nature and society. Such an understanding must encompass the interaction of global processes with the ecological and social characteristics of particular places and sectors” (Kates et al. 2001, 1).",

Descriptive statements describe the current state (“is”, e.g., vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins), while normative statements describe the ideal state (“ought”, e.g., you should eat vegetables). In everyday life, the distinction between “is” and “ought” is often not recognized, but it is crucial for science. Moreover, it is essential to recognize that individuals hold diverse perspectives, which can lead to diverging opinions regarding what is optimal or what sustainability should entail. Consequently, the concepts of “sustainability” or “sustainable development” cannot be regarded as impartial or neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Distinction between empirical-analytical and normative (Own illustration).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet active - Dilemmas\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on an issue in your personal/social environment, where different persons have different ideas about how a problem should be solved or what sustainability should look like.",

    "section": "1.3 Ethics",
    "text": "1.3 Ethics\nBecause sustainability/sustainable development is per se normative, this can lead to dilemmas (which means problems do not have an optimal solution). When looking at wicked problems such as biodiversity loss in agricultural areas there are multiple possible approaches: (1) protecting and promoting rare and extinction-threatened species and therefore reducing food production or (2) focusing on species with great abundance, which might be more important to economics and food security but would neglect rare species.\nDepending on context, background and/or beliefs, some would prefer one approach over the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Sustainable Development as a normative concept (Own illustration).\n\n\n\nEthics offers orientation and decision-making structures in order to find a suitable course of action in situations such as complex dilemmas. Ethics deals with the reflection and evaluation of moral actions and behaviour and is therefore the philosophical study of morals (moral norms, value judgments and institutions). There are numerous ethical approaches, two central ones of normative ethics being “teleological” and “deontological” approaches. Teleological ethics evaluates actions based on their goals or purposes, which are considered “good”. An example of this is utilitarianism (established by Jeremy Bentham), which judges actions according to how much utility or happiness they produce. Deontological ethics, on the other hand, focuses on duties and evaluates actions based on their characteristics rather than their consequences. An example of this is Kant’s duty-based ethics (Kantianism), which judges actions according to whether they comply with a moral rule or duty.\nThe concept of sustainability usually has a positive connotation, but it can be viewed from different perspectives. In order to function as a guiding principle (in an ecological, social, and economic sense), it requires clear criteria. But what grounds can we use to define these criteria?\nAccording to Hirsch Hadorn and Brun (2007), “sustainable development” should:\n\nfulfil needs…\n… in a just way\n… with a view to people living today and in the future, and\ntaking into account the diversity of values and the limit to which nature can be used.\n\nThe guiding principle of sustainable development is therefore not only the result of scientific research, but is first and foremost a normative, ethically based concept. It brings together “ethical and analytical ideas” and formulates “norms that express what is desirable and what should happen” (Renn et al. 2007, 39). As a result, sustainable development is a social process of negotiation and decision-making – of searching, learning, and gaining experience – that is guided by ethical considerations. Accordingly, sustainability research must always be aware of its involvement in social processes of perception and evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Jonas’ Ethics of Responsibility (1979)\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Jonas’ ethics of responsibility (1979) offers an important contribution to the sustainability debate by emphasizing the ethical responsibility for future generations and nature. Jonas’ approach can be described as a kind of “future ethics” that aims to address the specific new challenges of action in the context of “technological civilization”. The link to sustainability ethics lies in his understanding of the concept of responsibility: Jonas understands ethical responsibility as a “non-reciprocal relationship” (Jonas 1987, 177), the asymmetry of which is derived from the power of a moral subject over one or something else that requires care: “Responsibility is the concern for another being, recognized as a duty, which becomes ‘concern’ when its vulnerability is threatened” (Jonas 1987, 391). Jonas’ approach differs from other ethical theories in that it does not take the existence of humanity for granted and includes duties to future generations as well as to nature. Jonas argues that the first duty of future ethics is to grasp the distant effects of human action (Jonas 1987, 64). In view of the uncertainty about the future effects of human action, he advocates the decision rule “in dubio pro malo” (in doubt for the bad): “[…] when in doubt, give ear to the worse prognosis before the better, for the stakes have become too great for the game” (Jonas 1987, 67). Jonas thus develops a new categorical imperative that demands the preservation of nature and humanity and is based on the assumption of an intrinsic purposefulness of nature: “Act in such a way that the effects of your action are contractual with the permanence of genuine human life on earth”, or “Act in such a way that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibilities of such life” (Jonas 1987, 36).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbons, Michael, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, and Simon Schwartzman. 2010.

    "text": "2.3 Quality criteria of trandisciplinary research\nSustainability sciences often follow transdisciplinary research designs. Belcher et al. (2016) describe transdisciplinary research as crossing disciplinary and institutional boundaries, and as being context specific, and problem oriented. Moreover, it combines and blends methodologies from different theoretical paradigms, includes a diversity of both academic and societal actors, and is conducted with a range of research goals, organizational forms, and outputs. It is widely acknowledged that complex and wicked social problems, as those who are the research topics of sustainability sciences, as well as the claim to contribute to reals world solutions, are best approaches by such comprehensive and holistic approaches such as provided by transdisciplinary research designs. However, as boundaries between disciplines are crossed, and as research engages more with stakeholders in complex systems, traditional academic definitions and criteria of research quality are no longer sufficient—there is a need for a parallel evolution of principles and criteria to define and evaluate research quality in a transdisciplinary research context. This is, why Belcher et al. (2016) propose, based on a comprehensive literature review, the following four quality criteria for transdisciplinary research (cf. Table 3 in Belcher et al. 2016):\n\nRelevance: The importance, significance, and usefulness of the research problem, objectives, processes, and findings to the problem context\nCredibility: The research findings are robust and the sources of knowledge are dependable. This includes clear demonstration of the adequacy of the data and the methods used to procure the data including clearly presented and logical interpretation of findings\nLegitimacy: The research process is perceived as fair and ethical. This encompasses the ethical and fair representation of all involved and the appropriate and genuine inclusion and consideration of diverse participants, values, interests, and perspectives\nEffectiveness: The research generates knowledge and stimulates actions that address the problem and contribute to solutions and innovation\n\nThe quality of transdisciplinary knowledge production therefore does not follow any rigid quality criteria of disciplinary research paradigms. Rather, various methodological approaches are combined, depending on the best fit with the desired research objectives and questions, with regard to the inclusion of all participants, and with regard to implementation and solution-orientation. The selected research approaches are implemented in such a way as to maximise credibility. Following Belcher et al. (2016), credible high-quality research is authoritative, transparent, defensible, believable, and rigorous. For this, traditional disciplinary criteria can be applied to transdisciplinary research. However, additional and modified criteria are needed to address the integration of epistemologies and methodologies and the development of novel methods through collaboration, the broad preparation and competencies required to carry out the research, and the need for reflection and adaptation when operating in complex systems.\nFor scientists who engage in or evaluate transdisciplinary research, this means that they should be open to and tolerant of different scientific methods and corresponding comprehensive set of quality criteria.\nMoreover, Walter and Kremer (2023, 340) argue that within transdisciplinary learning contexts, the different cultures of knowledge provide the potential for a more holistic reflection, and therefore more comprehensive understanding. Persons who intend to collaborate in a transdisciplinary research project or educational task should reflect on and communicate their sources of knowledge, its reliability, and limitations. Conscious discussion may enhance mutual understanding for different approaches, documentation, and methodologies in scientific knowledge acquisition and therefore may prevent possible misconceptions. In addition, this reflection may help to identify common points of contact and complementary additions to the various disciplinary levels of knowledge, thereby enhancing mutual learning.",

Rather, the transparent disclosure of sources and decisions made, the quality of the underlying data and the comprehensibility of interpretations are central to gaining confidence in the quality of the knowledge gained. In view of the possibilities created by intelligent systems (e.g., AI) in the production of knowledge, many researchers are also tempted to resort to questionable methods in the production of knowledge (see examples in Lüscher 2019). So, how can you recognise whether a scientific publication (especially if it does not originate from your own discipline) is of high quality?\nWe suggest the following questions that can be asked of a publication in order to assess its quality:\nWhat is the quality of the content?\n\nThe aformentioned quality criteria can be applied here\n\nWho is/are the author(s)?\n\nIs/are the author(s) writing about a topic on which they are also conducting research (or are they commenting on topics that do not correspond to their primary research)?\nDoes the author(s) have a reputation in this field?\nMight there be any conflicts of interest?\n\nWho is the publisher?\n\nDoes the publisher specialise in scientific publications in the relevant subject area?\nWhat is the reputation of the publisher (see list of predatory publishers)?\nMight there be any conflicts of interest?\n\nWho is the target audience?\n\nWas the publication written for a scientific audience (or is it, for example, a textbook for students or a specialist article for a non-scientific audience)?\n\nHow was the publication received in the scientific community?\n\nHas the publication been cited by others (cf. citation indices)?\nAre there any reviews?\n\nPlease note that there is no simple yes-no answer regarding the quality of publications.

    "text": "3.1 Three types of Knowledge\nSystems knowledge is defined as the comprehension of the existing state of a system, encompassing the investigation of pertinent structures and processes, as well as their intricacy and dynamics within the framework of sustainable development. This is accomplished through a variety of methods, including qualitative and quantitative approaches, mixed methods, experiments, and system dynamics approaches, which frequently incorporate forecasts, retrospectives, and scenario analyses. The majority of studies on the generation of systems knowledge are classified as empirical research (Figure 3.1).\nTarget knowledge refers to what should be achieved and what should be avoided, and is particularly relevant through normative research. This encompasses the interpretation and concretization of the values associated with sustainable development, as well as the derivation of additional norms. Research that addresses the definition of thresholds, assessment methods, and visioning processes facilitates the formulation of clear recommendations regarding the necessary transformations (Figure 3.1).\nTransformation knowledge is the process of moving from the current state to the desired state, achieved through the integration of both system and target knowledge. This entails the pursuit of demonstrably effective solutions to identified problems within the context of sustainable development. There are a number of methods that can be employed to achieve this. (translated from Ilias and enhanced with deepl) Research on transformations, i.e. the change in social organisation at different levels, can be both empirical and normative. Research focussing on past and present transformations is empirical. In contrast, research focussing on how concrete goals can be achieved is normative. This distinction is also acknowledged by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), which employs the terms “transformation” or “transformative research.” In the context of transformations, transformative education is emphasised, which aims to promote the acquisition of skills for a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of change (Schneidewind 2013). The objective is to enhance the capacity for reflection within society, encompassing both the terms and ability of observing and actively shaping transformation processes (Figure 3.1).",

Referring to sources not only acknowledges the knowledge of others, it also makes your own contribution more comprehensible and more substantial.\nIn their introductory work, Zabed and Qi (2022, 493) give numerous examples of when a reference is required:\n\nWhen describing or discussing a definition, theory, model, concept, or practice associated with a particular writer; e.g., “Referencing can be defined as the acknowledgement of the works or ideas of other persons, which have been published formally or are available in the public domain in another way” (Reference).\nTo demonstrate the importance of the work; e.g., “It has been reported that environmental conditions significantly affect the growth of a crop during field experiment” (Reference).\nTo point out a research gap in the report; e.g., “In a recent study, it has been pointed out that still there is no scientific data on how the migrant workers can contribute to the social stability of the country” (Reference).\nTo show the vastness of the research work on the specific topic of the writer; e.g., “Numerous studies have been done over the last several decades to improve technical and technological aspects of energy production” (Reference-1; Reference-2; Reference-3 and so on).\nTo describe the method(s) used in the study; e.g., “Starch content in the rice flour was determined by the enzymatic method” (Reference).\nTo mention the source of data used in the research/report; e.g., “Data present in this report on weather conditions during the experiment were obtained from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Malaysia” (Reference).\nTo identify the source of a material or equipment used during an experiment; e.g., “The constructs used in this study were drawn from recent research” (Reference)\nTo show the similarity of the research outcome(s) to others’ work; e.g., “In our investigation, it was observed that organizational performance decreased significantly with the decrease in workforce diversity. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere” (Reference).\nTo compare the study results with literature; e.g., “The blood pressure (BP) was recorded 140/95 in a patient under a stress condition. In an earlier study, BP was reported 145/90 in a patient under the same stress condition” (Reference).\nTo explain the research outcomes logically; e.g., “It was observed that ethanol concentration reached a plateau after a certain time. This might have happened for the exhaustion of soluble sugars over time” (Reference).\n\nKnowledge that can be assumed as general knowledge for the target audience (e.g., in the introduction) does not have to be referenced. For example: “climate change is a mayor threat to food systems”.\nOwn statements, considerations and conclusions (unless they refer to earlier, published material) do not have to contain references. They can be made explicitly recognizable as such to the reader with an active choice of words (examples: I / we propose … I / we assume, … I / we conclude …).",

Paraphrased passages, direct quotations and other material (e.g. images) taken from third parties (or from our own earlier publications) are identified as such. In the case of protected material, appropriate permission must also be obtained for its use.\nA reference system consists of a style that is consistently applied to the whole product, based on two elements (Zabed and Qi 2022):\n\nCiting the source material in the text\nListing the full details of each source (usually at the end), so that it is easy to find. This list does not contain any entries that do not also appear within the text.\n\nThere exist numerous different reference styles. These are sometimes specified by a particular academic field, or by a particular publication format (e.g. a specific journal). Examples of reference styles that use the “in-text name style” are APA, Chicago or Harvard. Examples of reference styles that use the “in-text numerical style” are Vancouver, ACS or IEEE.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise by the lecturers, you are free to choose which citation style you would like to use in our degree program, but you are expected to transparently refer to third party work by referencing it and to apply the chosen reference style consistently across the whole publication. For each style, there are extensive rules on how to refer to sources in the text and how to present different types of sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples for reference styles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA reference style\nVancouver reference style",

This relates to several levels of accountability, including those of individual researchers, their institutions, (potential) clients, the government, and the general public. Only a high level of integrity allows to maintain society’s trust in research, to protect the reputation of researchers and institutions, to ensure the reproducibility of research results, and to prevent fraud and misconduct (Alavi and Schmohl 2023).\nGood scientific practice and scientific integrity adheres to legal regulations (e.g. New Federal Act on Data Protection), as well as principles and codes of conduct on research ethics and scientific integrity of the scientific academies (e.g. The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of All European Academies, or the Code of conduct for scientific integrity of the Swiss Academies). Various scientific communities and academic fields also specify further codes and principles ( e.g., the Guide for Transboundary Research Partnerships of the Swiss Alliance for Global Research Partnerships, the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct of the American Psychology Association, or the Code of Ethics of the International Sociological Association).\nFor international and interdisciplinary researchers, this means that they must actively inform themselves about the applicable laws in the countries in which they conduct their research, as well as the applicable principles and codes of conduct of their (disciplinary) research communities.\nIn our view, the following principles are particularly important for students on the Master’s programme on Sustainability Transformations.",

    "text": "5.2 Basic principles\nBased on recommendations of All European Academies (ALLEA), the Swiss Academies have formulated four basic principles of scientific integrity (Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences 2021, 15):\n\nReliability in ensuring the quality of research and teaching in order to maximise the credibility of, and trust in, science. Reliability is reflected in particular in the design, methodology, and analysis of research; it involves both transparency and traceability.\nHonesty in developing, designing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research and teaching activities. These activities should be carried out in a transparent manner with a view to achieving maximum impartiality.\nRespect for colleagues, students, study and research participants, society, our cultural heritage, ecosystems and the environment. Due consideration should be given to the diversity and life experience of all persons involved.\nAccountability for research – from an idea to its valorisation and transfer – and for its administration and organisation as well as for training, supervision, mentoring, and the careful use of resources.\n\nMoreover, the EU specified in its European Charter for Researchers a set of general principles and requirements which specifies the roles, responsibilities and entitlements of researchers. They are aimed at all researchers at all stages of their careers and cover all areas of research in the public and private sectors. The Charter formulates the following general principles and requirements for researchers:\n\nResearch freedom\nProfessional attitude\nGood practice in research\nRelation with supervisors\nEthical principles\nContractual and legal obligations\nDissemination, exploitation of results\nSupervision and managerial duties\nProfessional responsibility\nAccountability\nPublic engagement\nContinuing professional development",

    "text": "5.3 Good research practices\nFrom these basic principles, more concrete implications for good scientific practices can be derived, for example (for more details cf. Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences 2021):\n\n5.3.1 In the production and dissemination of knowledge\n\nResponsible data management is required when handling the data. This ensures security and longevity of data, as well as reproducibility of research results. On the one hand, the procedures follow the requirements of data protection guidelines and data management plans, on the other hand, they are oriented on Open Science Guidelines.\nWhen producing knowledge, it is important to disclosure apparent, potential, and actual conflicts of interests. It is also required to respect intellectual property, and to explicitly and correctly refer to existing knowledge and literature\nIt also means to use AI in research responsibly and make their use transparent (cf. CDE AI Guidelines) It goes without saying that due diligence is required when collecting and analysing data and no practices that contravene scientific integrity are used (such as e.g. data fabrication, cf. also the regulations concerning scientific integrity of the University of Bern, Article 5).\n\n\n\n5.3.2 In the collaboration with colleagues\n\nGood practice in this regard includes, for example, naming all persons who have made a significant contribution to the planning, realisation and quality as authors.\nPeer review procedures are an important quality assurance mechanism in science. Researchers should also make their contribution here and provide appropriate feedback with a commitment to objectivity, impartiality, and confidentiality.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 When involving human participangs in data collection1\n\nWhen data is collected from human participants (mostly in humanities and social sciences, as well as in transdisciplinary research, e.g. through observations or surveys, but also on social media), it is essential to comply with the applicable data protection laws. Both the European Data Protection Act and the New Federal Act on Data Protection stipulate corresponding requirements.\nThe different (disciplinary) research communities often go one step further in their research ethics guidelines (e.g. the Ethics in Social Science and Humanities for the European Commission). These place the dignity and well-being of the participants at the center, particularly, if vulnerable groups are involved. Most of these research ethical guidelines are based on the Belmont Report of the National Commission for the protection of Human Subjects of biomedical and behavioural Research of the United States. The Belmont Report defines three basic ethical principles:\n\nRespect for Persons expresses the ethical convictions that the autonomy of individuals should be respected and that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to equal protection.\n➔ This results, for example, in the requirements of voluntariness, confidentiality/anonymity, and informed consent.\nBeneficence describes an obligation to protect subjects from harm by maximizing possible benefits and minimizing possible harms. ➔ Participants must not suffer any impairments or disadvantages as a result of their participation (e.g. no negative emotions). If this is the case, such burdens must be justified by the benefits of the research. An ethics committee should decide whether this is the case.\nJustice promotes equitable representation in research in terms of fairly distributing the risks and benefits of research. ➔ The groups of people involved must not suffer any disadvantages as a result of their participation (e.g. refusal of treatment if they are assigned to the control group).",

In order to put this goal into practice, a participatory strategy process was initiated with numerous stakeholders from the region. Representatives from the public sector, local clubs and associations, the tourism and mobility sector, energy producers and suppliers, the private sector and the agricultural and forestry sectors have developed a joint “vision” and “transition paths” (these describe the steps required to realize the vision). In addition, initial “transition experiments” were outlined (i.e. pilot projects that reduce regional GHG emissions, such as support for biogas production by local farmers). All of this was published in a “Transition Agenda”.\nThis process was initiated, accompanied and researched by an inter- and transdisciplinary team of CDE researchers from the disciplines of psychology, geography and communication sciences together with representatives of regional authorities. CDE researchers were responsible for identifying and involving key regional stakeholders, as well as facilitating a series of workshops to develop the transition agenda. In addition, a survey was conducted among the local population to find out whether they supported the vision developed by the regional representatives. The results of the survey were then incorporated into the strategy process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Visions of a climate neutral region Oberland-Ost (illustration by Samuel Bucheli).\n\n\n\nThe project was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE (Energy Research and Cleantech Section) and co-financed by the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern and the Economic, Energy and Environmental Directorate of the Canton of Bern.\nMore Information on the project on the CDE-project website.",

It is therefore of great importance for students to gain an understanding of their socialization and the methods they have employed during their studies. This enables them to engage in critical evaluation and application of different research methods in their respective fields. Moreover, it is essential to understand the relative merits and limitations of each approach and its potential applicability in inter- and transdisciplinary contexts.",

    "text": "7.2 ID/TD methods\nAt present, there is a considerable array of distinct ID/TD methodologies, derived from both research and practice. The objective of this section is not to present a comprehensive account of applied methods; rather, it aims to offer insights into a select number of methods. However, before we start to explore ID/TD methods, it is essential to acknowledge that a vast variety of scientific methods are used. Various scientific methods offer specific approaches to analysing the objects of investigation and are considered complementary, as they provide different approaches to description and explanation. The choice of method therefore depends heavily on the research question and the object of investigation (cf. Schirmer 2009, 129ff). The range of scientific methods is huge, making it difficult to categorise them. Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) used semi-structured interviews with scientists to ask about their understanding of the frequently used categorisation into quantitative and qualitative research. It is important to note here that the categorisation into quantitative and qualitative methods is made particularly in the social sciences - as Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) show. In some disciplines, researchers only conduct a certain type of research and never need anything other than clear ‘quantitative’ definitions (e.g. mathematical sciences); others only conduct research that involves texts but not numbers (e.g. literary studies). Further, some researchers considered how certain aspects lie outside the ‘qualitative’ or ‘quantitative’ (e.g. the ‘theoretical’ in German studies), or they conducted research that they considered to contain no ‘knowledge’ (sculpture in the visual arts), while others conducted basic ‘conceptual’ research that they considered to be at a stage prior to any quantity or quality judgement (philosophy). Finally, some researchers considered the terms to be of little relevance to their specialisms.\nIn many cases, the problems and issues in sustainability science require integrative, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in addition to human and natural science methods. By definition, interdisciplinary science, as sustainability science is, positions itself across the disciplines. For them, translations between disciplines are important. And when transdisciplinary approaches enter the respective social field and thus dissolve the disciplinary institutional distance, this must also have methodological consequences: It is about more inductive approaches in which the multiplicity of positions and approaches is recognised (Berger 2010). Collaboration in heterogeneous groups with experts and stakeholders (from science and/or practice) creates a mutual learning and research process, as all those involved can contribute their specific experience, knowledge and disciplinary methods to the project. In this way, existing methods are sometimes recombined and reimplemented.\nInterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods are characterised by the fact that they support the integration of different knowledge and enable co-creative processes for the development of sustainability contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring methods\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the wide variety of applied ID/TD methods, we won’t be able to demonstrate everything in our study programme. Therefore, you can also explore some ID/TD methods yourself:\n\nExplore the td-net Toolbox and read through the presented methods. We recommend reading the tools “actor constellation”, “three types of knowledge tool”, and “Theory of Change”. Feel free to read through further methods/tools.\nWe recommend to read the chapters “Citizen Science” and “Indigenous Knowledge” from the “Handbook Transdisciplinary Learning” (Philipp and Schmohl 2023).

    "text": "1.0.1 The discipline of economics\nThe term ‘economics’ helps to situate the discipline within the broader landscape of academic fields (see Fig. 1). As part of the humanities and cultural sciences, economic science deals explicitly with the economy as a man-made object of study (Engelkamp and Sell (2013), p. 3). Economic science can be divided into two broad areas: economics and business administration.\nBusiness administration: “Business administration is the study of the economic, organizational, technical, and financial processes in companies and various economic institutions” (Friedli, Müller Vasquez Callo, and Balmer-Zahnd (2019), p. 16, own translation). In this field, researchers develop a microeconomic perspective on the respective subject of investigation.\nEconomics: Unlike business administration, economics does not examine what happens within economic actors but focuses on the interaction between the various economic actors and also takes a macroeconomic perspective. In this course, we will deal with this part of economic science.\nWith the development and differentiation of economic theories, various definitions of economics have been established and advocated. The most widely accepted definition within economics today was originally proposed by Lionel Robbins and emphasizes the relationship between the scarcity of resources and the satisfaction of needs by economic agents. Robbins defines economics as follows: “Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses” (Robbins (1932), p. 15). Robbins’ definition is influenced by his theoretical orientation along the neoclassical school of thought (mainstream/orthodox economics). Building on this, most mainstream textbooks define economics as a science of (rational) decision-making that deals with how people make decision in the light of scarce resources to achieve their goals.\nThe heterodox economist Ha-Joon Chang criticizes this definition as too specific and argues that it stems from a theoretical approach and thus already prescribes a certain approach (Chang (2014)). Chang defines economics not by its theoretical approach, but by its object of study: the economy. Economics therefore deals with everything related to the (re)production, exchange, and distribution of goods and services to satisfy human needs. In addition to and between these definitions, there are many other definitions of economics. Based on different understandings of economics, different schools of thought consequently focus on different subject areas, such as power structures, institutions, or macroeconomic and social relationships and structures. In the section on pluralist economics (section 3), we will take a closer look at what constitutes neoclassical economics (mainstream) and learn more about some of the other schools of thought. In the following, we will generally follow Chang’s understanding, which takes the subject of investigation and not a theoretical approach as the basis for our understanding of economics. Accordingly, this understanding also allows for many different approaches and schools of thought to be used to understand economic relationships.",

    "text": "Learning Outcome\n\n\nStudents…\n\ncan explain what the term “social physics” means. - recognize the implications of applying social-physical principles in economics.\n\n\n\nWalter Ötsch is a professor at the Koblenz University of Applied Sciences. As an economist and cultural historian, he researches and publishes on socio-political and economic topics such as populism and the social role of markets. Below you will find a section (chapter 4-9) of a working paper written by him. In this working paper Walter Ötsch describes how economics developed from the moral science of Adam Smith to a science with a biologically determined view of human nature under Malthus and Ricardo. In this process, scientific metaphors (clock system, balance scale, computer information) became increasingly important and economics is increasingly seen as “social physics”. This process is very illustrative for the development of modern neoclassical economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief digression: History of Homo Economicus (optional for interested readers)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe history of homo economicus dates back at least to the mention of “economicus” in Xenophon’s work of the same name in the fourth century BC (Wilson and Dixon (2014), p. 11). In the long period leading up to the establishment of modern economics by Adam Smith in the 18th century, various conceptions of economic man were used[1] , often strongly influenced by the corresponding “Zeitgeist”. The concept of homo economicus as a rational utility maximizer is often attributed to Smith, as he recognized self-love as a central characteristic of human behavior. However, as is often the case with Smith’s concepts, this common interpretation is oversimplified. In addition to self-love, Adam Smith identifies other human characteristics that are central to human behavior. Smith paints a much more complex picture of human behavior than the reduced version of modern homo economicus (Hill 2012). Smith’s dense description of economic man makes it impossible to model him or work with him mathematically (Morgan (2006); Morgan (2012)). This was changed over time through a conscious reduction of the description of the economic man.\n[1] In this text, the term “economic man” is used when referring to the idea of an economic agent. This is because the term “homo economicus” represents the currently dominant conception and “economic man” is used in this sense in (predominantly English) literature. The term is problematic in that it implies the exclusion of an “economic woman”. However, if we consider the orientation of economics today and also throughout history, such a representation of economics is unfortunately not too far-fetched as feminist economists have argued many times.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Thomas Robert Malthus and David Ricardo were already using somewhat reduced versions of economic man, which already had certain model characteristics (Morgan 1996, 2006, 2012). John Stuart Mill took this further and reduced economic man to the characteristics that were central to the economic sphere: the desire to accumulate wealth, the aversion to work, and the desire for luxury goods (Mill (1996)). Although the model of economic man underwent a reduction in Malthus, Ricardo, and Mill, the model of economic man cannot yet be used in the same way as it is today.\nWilliam Stanley Jevons and Francis Edgeworth laid the foundations for this development at the end of the 19th century. Alongside Alfred Marshall, Léon Walras, and Vilfredo Pareto, they are considered important founders of neoclassical economics and were part of the marginalist revolution (this will be discussed in more detail in section 3 on basic concepts of economics; see the marginal principle). Like some other economists with a background in mathematics or physics, the two economists were determined to turn economics into a natural science. Neoclassical economists were convinced that the analytical and deductive method should also be the ideal approach for economics. Jevons justified the necessity of mathematics for economics simply by pointing out that it deals with quantities (Jevons (1879), p. 4). This group of economists was guided by physics and physical concepts. Irving Fisher, another of the first neoclassical economists, explicitly used various mechanical or hydraulic concepts for his theories and applied them to economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Fisher’s mechanical balance of exchange to illustrate the quantity theory of money (Fischer 1922,p.21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Fisher uses a hydraulic model to illustrate purchasing power in a bimetallism system (Fisher 1922, p. 119)\n\n\n\nThe idea of equilibrium itself is a concept borrowed from physics. This fixation on physics is also described as “physics envy”, and Mirowski shows that this orientation toward physics was a fundamental driver in the development of the history of economic thought (Mirowski (1989), p. 396). Even well into the 20th century, the explicit analogy to physics remained in economics. A good example of this, and also of the basic toolbox of economists, is the machine built by William Phillips in the 1940s to represent the British economy. The development of homo economicus is also exemplary of the mechanistic worldview that emerged in neoclassical economics, as described by Walter Ötsch in his text. \nAmong other things, the complexity of economic man stood in the way of the applicability of mathematics to economics. Jevons therefore attempted to reduce this complexity. Influenced by Bentham’s utilitarianism, Jevons reduced the seven criteria formulated by Bentham, which are central to the calculation of utility and thus influence human behavior, to just two, arguing that only these were economically relevant (Jevons (1879), p. 17). This enabled Jevons to work mathematically with economic man (Reiss (2000)). This abstraction and objectification of economics and economic man is most clearly illustrated by the concepts developed by Francis Endgeworth and later Frank Knight. Endgeworth refers to economic man as a “pleasure machine” and Knight as a “slot machine” (Morgan (2006)). Pareto’s use of his “homo economicus” also establishes an analysis of humans from a mechanical perspective. Pareto writes: “Just as analytical mechanics deals with material points and rigid bodies, mathematical economics considers an abstract human being, a homo economicus” (Pareto (1902), p. 1100).\nWith the marginalist revolution, homo economicus became the focus of economics, in stark contrast to classical economists (Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, Marx), who focused primarily on class analysis. In addition, abstraction now enabled modeling and mathematical applications, which was intended to bring economics closer to the natural sciences. The rational and utility-maximizing agent became the basis of economics. The underlying rational choice theory was subsequently further developed and adapted (e.g., through the concept of bounded rationality) but remains fundamentally the same to this day.\nThe history behind this development shows that it was not a natural one, but rather a conscious effort to push a certain direction in economics. For example, the neoclassical approach makes it impossible to identify and analyze structural problems, as the focus is on marginal changes in certain indicators (e.g., inflation or interest rates). A good example of this is the work of the winners of the 2019 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michale Kremer. In their research on poverty reduction, they use experiments (randomized control trials) to investigate the impact of specific individual measures to combat poverty. The analysis (and thus also a change) of the structural causes of these people’s poverty is lost sight of here.\nThe descriped development in economics was heavily criticized when it first emerged. Criticism of its focus, its fixation on analytical models and its strong abstraction from the real world continues to this day. In view of the weaknesses that have been increasingly exposed in neoclassical economics in the years since the 2008 financial crisis, the concerns of Alfred Marshall – himself a famous neoclassical economist – about this development are once again becoming relevant. In 1881, in a commentary on Edgeworth’s “Mathematical Psychics,” Marshall wondered whether Edgeworth would succeed in preventing mathematics from running away with him and driving him out of sight of the actual facts of economics (Vazquez (1995), p. 251).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following further reading is recommended for students who would like to delve deeper and engage more intensively with the history of theory:\n\n\nAmbler, Lucy, Joe Earle, und Nicola Scott. 2022. «Whitewashes History».

    "text": "3.1 Forms of provisioning in the economy\nThis module deals with the basic concepts of economics. It is intended as an introduction to the central concepts and topics of economics. We are aware that many of these terms are new to students without a background in economics. Thus, the aim of this module is not to provide you with detailed knowledge of all topics, but rather to give you an initial overview of economics. For students of economics, this chapter serves as a review and contextualization of existing knowledge.\nEach basic concept is accompanied by a number of in-depth questions. These serve to allow you to test your knowledge of the respective area independently but are also intended to stimulate thought and reflection. If you have any questions about the content or would like to explore a topic in greater depth, you can contact us (see information document).\nBy the end of this volume you will find a link to the quiz on the basic concepts of economics. This quiz is part of the assessment and will account for 40% of your final grade. Consult the information document for more information.\nAt the latest with the division of labor, questions arise for an economic system about the organization of (re)production, consumption, and distribution. This raises the following fundamental questions:\nAs the previous section has made clear, the answers depend on the perspective we take and our understanding of the economy. Here we follow Karl Polanyi, who proposes a broad understanding of the economy. Karl Polanyi distinguishes between two definitions of economy: one formal and one substantive (Polanyi (1977)). From the formalist position, economic activity is analyzed in the neoclassical sense as a purpose-rational and utility-maximizing activity in markets under conditions of scarcity. Since economic activity is reduced to market economies, essential economic sectors such as domestic and care work or public provisioning are only covered to a limited extent. Fundamental, non-market institutions of economic activity are examined, but only from the perspective of how these areas of human life can also be optimized. However, this is problematic: rationality optimizes but does not concern itself with what is being optimized, why, and for whom.\nFrom the substantivist position, economic activity is understood as being embedded in communities and biophysical foundations. Economic activity therefore means providing the foundations of life. It does not mean optimizing to maximize utility (Nelson (1993)). Markets are not always suitable for securing the foundations of human life in all economic sectors. Economics is therefore more than market economies. The economy consists of different institutions and sectors with different logics: housing cooperatives work with different business models than plumbers and steel companies, public hospitals differ from industrial companies, and unpaid care work is organized differently than assembly line work. Karl Polanyi therefore distinguishes between four socio-economic organizational principles or forms of provisioning (what he calls forms of integration) that can be found in real economies and interact in different ways: household, reciprocity, redistribution, and market trade (Polanyi (2017)).\n(1) Householding refers to forms of self-sufficiency and is rooted in families and households. In ancient Greece, the oikos, or household, was a self-sufficient economic unit. Even today, however, a large part of the economy continues to take place in the household, particularly in the form of unpaid care work, nursing, and housework (e.g., cooking, cleaning, gardening).\n(2) Reciprocity is based on the principle of give and take and defines an exchange of goods and services between individuals outside the market and the state. This takes place in communities, e.g., among friends, in the neighborhood, or in associations, and includes neighborhood assistance and community work. Like the principle of householding, the form of provisioning/integration of reciprocity has its roots often in local communities and usually takes place between people who know each other.\n(3) Redistribution defines a systematic flow of resources to an administrative center and their subsequent redistribution. Examples include public education, health, and pension systems financed by taxes or levies. Redistribution allocates resources to (often unknown) members of a society. It takes place within political territories, especially the nation-state, and therefore extends beyond local communities.\n(4) Finally, (market) exchange defines the exchange of goods and services at market prices. This is the commodified area of economic activity. These markets can differ depending on the type of goods and services traded, their reach, and their structure. The logic of individual profit and solvency prevails in market relationships.\nIn summary: To this day, economic activity is shaped by a variety of institutions and principles. Real economies are always mixed economies, i.e., they are more than market economies. Not all aspects of life and economic activity are suitable for being transformed into goods that are exchanged in a market (commodified).",

    "text": "3.2 Referring to third party work\nRegardless of which format is chosen, a scientific research procedure is characterized (and differentiated from a non-scientific approach) by the fact that it is shown in a transparent and comprehensible way, which existing knowledge of third parties is referred to. This means that it must be clearly recognizable which statements are your own and which statements have been taken from others, as well as where they can be found. If this is not done, one speaks of plagiarism. Plagiarism is the stealing of other’s work without appropriately crediting or acknowledging the source and is considered misconducting scientific practice (Zabed and Qi 2022). Referring to sources not only acknowledges the knowledge of others, it also makes your own contribution more comprehensible and more substantial.\nIn their introductory work, Zabed and Qi (2022, 493) give numerous examples of when a reference is required:\n\nWhen describing or discussing a definition, theory, model, concept, or practice associated with a particular writer; e.g., “Referencing can be defined as the acknowledgement of the works or ideas of other persons, which have been published formally or are available in the public domain in another way” (Reference).\nTo demonstrate the importance of the work; e.g., “It has been reported that environmental conditions significantly affect the growth of a crop during field experiment” (Reference).\nTo point out a research gap in the report; e.g., “In a recent study, it has been pointed out that still there is no scientific data on how the migrant workers can contribute to the social stability of the country” (Reference).\nTo show the vastness of the research work on the specific topic of the writer; e.g., “Numerous studies have been done over the last several decades to improve technical and technological aspects of energy production” (Reference-1; Reference-2; Reference-3 and so on).\nTo describe the method(s) used in the study; e.g., “Starch content in the rice flour was determined by the enzymatic method” (Reference).\nTo mention the source of data used in the research/report; e.g., “Data present in this report on weather conditions during the experiment were obtained from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Malaysia” (Reference).\nTo identify the source of a material or equipment used during an experiment; e.g., “The constructs used in this study were drawn from recent research” (Reference)\nTo show the similarity of the research outcome(s) to others’ work; e.g., “In our investigation, it was observed that organizational performance decreased significantly with the decrease in workforce diversity. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere” (Reference).\nTo compare the study results with literature; e.g., “The blood pressure (BP) was recorded 140/95 in a patient under a stress condition. In an earlier study, BP was reported 145/90 in a patient under the same stress condition” (Reference).\nTo explain the research outcomes logically; e.g., “It was observed that ethanol concentration reached a plateau after a certain time. This might have happened for the exhaustion of soluble sugars over time” (Reference).\n\nKnowledge that can be assumed as general knowledge for the target audience (e.g., in the introduction) does not have to be referenced. For example: “climate change is a mayor threat to food systems”.\nOwn statements, considerations and conclusions (unless they refer to earlier, published material) do not have to contain references. They can be made explicitly recognizable as such to the reader with an active choice of words (examples: I / we propose … I / we assume, … I / we conclude …).",

Paraphrased passages, direct quotations and other material (e.g. images) taken from third parties (or from our own earlier publications) are identified as such. In the case of protected material, appropriate permission must also be obtained for its use.\nA reference system consists of a style that is consistently applied to the whole product, based on two elements (Zabed and Qi 2022):\n\nCiting the source material in the text\nListing the full details of each source (usually at the end), so that it is easy to find. This list does not contain any entries that do not also appear within the text.\n\nThere exist numerous different reference styles. These are sometimes specified by a particular academic field, or by a particular publication format (e.g. a specific journal). Examples of reference styles that use the “in-text name style” are APA, Chicago or Harvard. Examples of reference styles that use the “in-text numerical style” are Vancouver, ACS or IEEE.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise by the lecturers, you are free to choose which citation style you would like to use in our degree program, but you are expected to transparently refer to third party work by referencing it and to apply the chosen reference style consistently across the whole publication. For each style, there are extensive rules on how to refer to sources in the text and how to present different types of sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples for reference styles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA reference style\nVancouver reference style",

    "text": "4.1 Neoclassical economics\nAs the first sections have shown, economics is currently dominated by a single school of thought, neoclassical economics. However, economics consists of many different schools of thought based on different assumptions, with different perspectives and focuses, some of which use different methods and arrive at different conclusions. In order to meet the complexity of current challenges, we believe that it is essential to be able to draw on this diversity of theories and tools. This short module therefore aims to provide an introduction to the diversity of economics, known as pluralist economics.\nIn the course, there will be some opportunities to explore individual schools of thought in greater depth. However, it will not be possible to cover all schools of thought in depth. We are also happy to provide further material if you would like to explore pluralist economics or individual schools of thought in greater depth.\nThis section is not about knowing the details of the different schools of thought, but rather about becoming familiar with the diversity of economics. Accordingly, the section mainly provides material to explore the various schools of thought freely and even playfully. For this purpose, we created a crossword puzzle to explore the diversity of economics. You will find it later in the section.\nAs already indicated several times, current economic theory is strongly dominated by one school of thought, neoclassical economics. In the following, we will take a brief look at the basic principles of neoclassical economics and what is problematic about it from the perspective of a sustainable economics. Criticism of neoclassical economics should not be equated with the idea that neoclassical economics as a school of thought is obsolete. Rather, it is important to recognize the questions for which the neoclassical lens is useful and the questions for which other schools of thought offer more helpful perspectives. Furthermore, neoclassical economics is not a homogeneous field, remains a vague term, and is therefore sometimes used in different ways. The term was coined by Thorstein Veblen in the early 20th century to describe Alfred Marshall’s synthesis of subjective and objective value theory as a supply and demand diagram. Marshall combined the classical understanding that the value of a good is determined by its production costs with the new insights of the marginal utility school, which determined value by individual utility. The market diagram, which represents supply and demand, is at the heart of neoclassical economics.\nAccording to neoclassical understanding, the central problem of economics lies in the scarcity of societal resources, because it is assumed that human needs are fundamentally insatiable. Economics as a science therefore aims to study the functioning of a national economy in order to enable the highest possible level of prosperity through optimal resource allocation. Neoclassical theory bases its conception of the economy on rational individuals who are faced with alternatives that need to be weighed up and who want to maximize their own utility with their decisions. This weighing up of alternatives is based on a comparison of marginal utility and marginal costs. This involves the abstraction of homo economicus, who represents an ideal type of individual who acts rationally in the sense of maximizing utility and primarily with a view for his own self-interest. Based on this starting point of weighing up different alternatives, neoclassical economics is often understood as the science of decision-making, which makes it applicable to all areas of life. As we have already seen in the module on the basics of economics, the price mechanism in a market organizes the allocation of scarce resources and ensures that supply and demand, assuming perfect competition (see how the market works), settle at an equilibrium, which also corresponds to the economic optimum. From this perspective, the market emerges as the ideal form of allocation and state intervention as disruptive, which is expressed politically in the liberalization of markets and the reduction of the state to a minimum.\nAs already indicated several times, these assumptions underlying neoclassical economics, such as rational and utility-maximizing individuals and perfect competition, have been criticized from various voices. However, much more serious than the explicit assumptions are the implicit value judgments and predetermined perspective that are adopted when looking through neoclassical glasses. For example, entire sectors of the economy, such as the unpaid sector, are ignored. The idea of what economics is and what problems it addresses (allocation of scarce resources, focus on decision-making, etc.) is based on a normative foundation and defines the framework of possibilities. For example, markets are assumed to be natural, and the structural inequalities associated with them are accepted as given conditions. Improvements can only be achieved through marginal changes to certain target indicators within this framework.\nThese brief paragraphs on neoclassical economics and some of the criticisms raised are not intended to provide a comprehensive description, but merely to show that neoclassical economics takes a certain perspective (a more detailed description of neoclassical economics can be found here). We will examine specific aspects in more detail later on. Given its strengths and limitations, neoclassical economics is well suited to analyzing some issues, but less so for others. Economics offers a wide range of thought styles, which are suited to analyzing different problems to varying degrees. However, as will be explained below, economics is dominated by neoclassical economics, which prevents the economic toolkit from being used to its full potential. In this course, we also want to open your perspective to this diversity.",

Reliability is reflected in particular in the design, methodology, and analysis of research; it involves both transparency and traceability.\nHonesty in developing, designing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research and teaching activities. These activities should be carried out in a transparent manner with a view to achieving maximum impartiality.\nRespect for colleagues, students, study and research participants, society, our cultural heritage, ecosystems and the environment. Due consideration should be given to the diversity and life experience of all persons involved.\nAccountability for research – from an idea to its valorisation and transfer – and for its administration and organisation as well as for training, supervision, mentoring, and the careful use of resources.\n\nMoreover, the EU specified in its European Charter for Researchers a set of general principles and requirements which specifies the roles, responsibilities and entitlements of researchers. They are aimed at all researchers at all stages of their careers and cover all areas of research in the public and private sectors. The Charter formulates the following general principles and requirements for researchers:\n\nResearch freedom\nProfessional attitude\nGood practice in research\nRelation with supervisors\nEthical principles\nContractual and legal obligations\nDissemination, exploitation of results\nSupervision and managerial duties\nProfessional responsibility\nAccountability\nPublic engagement\nContinuing professional development",

    "text": "4.3 Good research practices\nFrom these basic principles, more concrete implications for good scientific practices can be derived, for example (for more details cf. Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences 2021):\n\n4.3.1 In the production and dissemination of knowledge\n\nResponsible data management is required when handling the data. This ensures security and longevity of data, as well as reproducibility of research results. On the one hand, the procedures follow the requirements of data protection guidelines and data management plans, on the other hand, they are oriented on Open Science Guidelines.\nWhen producing knowledge, it is important to disclosure apparent, potential, and actual conflicts of interests. It is also required to respect intellectual property, and to explicitly and correctly refer to existing knowledge and literature\nIt also means to use AI in research responsibly and make their use transparent (cf. CDE AI Guidelines) It goes without saying that due diligence is required when collecting and analysing data and no practices that contravene scientific integrity are used (such as e.g. data fabrication, cf. also the regulations concerning scientific integrity of the University of Bern, Article 5).\n\n\n\n4.3.2 In the collaboration with colleagues\n\nGood practice in this regard includes, for example, naming all persons who have made a significant contribution to the planning, realisation and quality as authors.\nPeer review procedures are an important quality assurance mechanism in science. Researchers should also make their contribution here and provide appropriate feedback with a commitment to objectivity, impartiality, and confidentiality.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 When involving human participangs in data collection1\n\nWhen data is collected from human participants (mostly in humanities and social sciences, as well as in transdisciplinary research, e.g. through observations or surveys, but also on social media), it is essential to comply with the applicable data protection laws. Both the European Data Protection Act and the New Federal Act on Data Protection stipulate corresponding requirements.\nThe different (disciplinary) research communities often go one step further in their research ethics guidelines (e.g. the Ethics in Social Science and Humanities for the European Commission). These place the dignity and well-being of the participants at the center, particularly, if vulnerable groups are involved. Most of these research ethical guidelines are based on the Belmont Report of the National Commission for the protection of Human Subjects of biomedical and behavioural Research of the United States. The Belmont Report defines three basic ethical principles:\n\nRespect for Persons expresses the ethical convictions that the autonomy of individuals should be respected and that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to equal protection.\n➔ This results, for example, in the requirements of voluntariness, confidentiality/anonymity, and informed consent.\nBeneficence describes an obligation to protect subjects from harm by maximizing possible benefits and minimizing possible harms. ➔ Participants must not suffer any impairments or disadvantages as a result of their participation (e.g. no negative emotions). If this is the case, such burdens must be justified by the benefits of the research. An ethics committee should decide whether this is the case.\nJustice promotes equitable representation in research in terms of fairly distributing the risks and benefits of research. ➔ The groups of people involved must not suffer any disadvantages as a result of their participation (e.g. refusal of treatment if they are assigned to the control group).",

    "text": "5.1 The world in transition – a polycrisis\nThe current economic system is leading to major challenges that are manifesting themselves in various crises. This current multitude of crises is recently referred to as a polycrisis (see, for example, Lawrence et al. 2024 or this explanatory video by Adam Tooze) because they affect people’s working and living environments in many different ways and are intertwined. Some of the individual crises are closely linked and have common causes. Others appear to be more independent of each other and do not necessarily have the same causes. Taken together, however, all these crises culminate in this often overwhelming polycrisis. In this section, we will analyze these crises before looking at solutions for a sustainable economy. In the following, we will address the ecological, social, and economic challenges separately. However, it is important to emphasize that these dimensions are strongly interlinked and can reinforce each other. Separating these areas is intended to facilitate the introduction.\nAs we have seen in the previous sections, the analysis itself is shaped by the perspective of the person conducting the analysis. The problem analysis can be different depending on the school of thought. For example, neoclassical economics doesn’t necessarily see rising income and wealth inequality as a problem as long as it’s caused by market mechanisms. A school of thought that includes power aspects in its analysis, such as feminist or Marxist economics, sees this inequality as a central problem for the economy and society. In line with the focus of this course, we will keep the problem analysis as broad as possible, covering all schools of thought.",

In order to put this goal into practice, a participatory strategy process was initiated with numerous stakeholders from the region. Representatives from the public sector, local clubs and associations, the tourism and mobility sector, energy producers and suppliers, the private sector and the agricultural and forestry sectors have developed a joint “vision” and “transition paths” (these describe the steps required to realize the vision). In addition, initial “transition experiments” were outlined (i.e. pilot projects that reduce regional GHG emissions, such as support for biogas production by local farmers). All of this was published in a “Transition Agenda”.\nThis process was initiated, accompanied and researched by an inter- and transdisciplinary team of CDE researchers from the disciplines of psychology, geography and communication sciences together with representatives of regional authorities. CDE researchers were responsible for identifying and involving key regional stakeholders, as well as facilitating a series of workshops to develop the transition agenda. In addition, a survey was conducted among the local population to find out whether they supported the vision developed by the regional representatives. The results of the survey were then incorporated into the strategy process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Visions of a climate neutral region Oberland-Ost (illustration by Samuel Bucheli).\n\n\n\nThe project was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE (Energy Research and Cleantech Section) and co-financed by the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern and the Economic, Energy and Environmental Directorate of the Canton of Bern.\nMore Information on the project on the CDE-project website.",

It is therefore of great importance for students to gain an understanding of their socialization and the methods they have employed during their studies. This enables them to engage in critical evaluation and application of different research methods in their respective fields. Moreover, it is essential to understand the relative merits and limitations of each approach and its potential applicability in inter- and transdisciplinary contexts.",

    "text": "6.2 ID/TD methods\nAt present, there is a considerable array of distinct ID/TD methodologies, derived from both research and practice. The objective of this section is not to present a comprehensive account of applied methods; rather, it aims to offer insights into a select number of methods. However, before we start to explore ID/TD methods, it is essential to acknowledge that a vast variety of scientific methods are used. Various scientific methods offer specific approaches to analysing the objects of investigation and are considered complementary, as they provide different approaches to description and explanation. The choice of method therefore depends heavily on the research question and the object of investigation (cf. Schirmer 2009, 129ff). The range of scientific methods is huge, making it difficult to categorise them. Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) used semi-structured interviews with scientists to ask about their understanding of the frequently used categorisation into quantitative and qualitative research. It is important to note here that the categorisation into quantitative and qualitative methods is made particularly in the social sciences - as Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) show. In some disciplines, researchers only conduct a certain type of research and never need anything other than clear ‘quantitative’ definitions (e.g. mathematical sciences); others only conduct research that involves texts but not numbers (e.g. literary studies). Further, some researchers considered how certain aspects lie outside the ‘qualitative’ or ‘quantitative’ (e.g. the ‘theoretical’ in German studies), or they conducted research that they considered to contain no ‘knowledge’ (sculpture in the visual arts), while others conducted basic ‘conceptual’ research that they considered to be at a stage prior to any quantity or quality judgement (philosophy). Finally, some researchers considered the terms to be of little relevance to their specialisms.\nIn many cases, the problems and issues in sustainability science require integrative, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in addition to human and natural science methods. By definition, interdisciplinary science, as sustainability science is, positions itself across the disciplines. For them, translations between disciplines are important. And when transdisciplinary approaches enter the respective social field and thus dissolve the disciplinary institutional distance, this must also have methodological consequences: It is about more inductive approaches in which the multiplicity of positions and approaches is recognised (Berger 2010). Collaboration in heterogeneous groups with experts and stakeholders (from science and/or practice) creates a mutual learning and research process, as all those involved can contribute their specific experience, knowledge and disciplinary methods to the project. In this way, existing methods are sometimes recombined and reimplemented.\nInterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods are characterised by the fact that they support the integration of different knowledge and enable co-creative processes for the development of sustainability contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring methods\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the wide variety of applied ID/TD methods, we won’t be able to demonstrate everything in our study programme.

From these more concrete approaches and policies will be derived which will be explored in section 7.\nIn view of the ecological limits of our planet, there is broad consensus at the scientific and political level in most highly industrialized countries that planetary boundaries must be respected in the long term. With the 1.5-degree and 2-degree targets, a central climate policy goal was also established internationally in the Paris Agreement, which Switzerland co-signed. With regard to economic and social challenges, the global community has also committed itself to the2030 Agenda, and Switzerland specifically articulated the goals in the 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy. These goals require a fundamental transformation of our economic system within a few decades. But how exactly should these goals be achieved? There are three basic strategies for implementing sustainable development that are currently being discussed: efficiency strategy, consistency strategy, and sufficiency strategy. All approaches to sustainable development are based on these three basic strategies, but they differ in how they align the interaction between the three strategies and in how they prioritize these strategies.\nVarious strategies are being discussed for implementing sustainable development: All three strategies must work together to achieve sustainability goals.",

    "text": "7.1 Approaches of sustainable economics\nAs outlined in the preceding section, the debates around sustainable economics are shaped by different guiding frameworks, which are influenced by various theoretical perspectives within pluralist economics and differ in their understanding of sustainability and their respective viewpoints. Most approaches within sustainable economics can be assigned to the post-growth framework. From the welfare capitalist framework, approaches such as green growth and the circular economy can be derived. The liberal market framework lies largely outside the debate of sustainable economics, although certain aspects of green growth are discussed, such as the internalization of external effects.\nIn the following, we will engage more deeply with specific approaches. Since the debates within sustainable economics are very diverse, no definitive or fixed classification of the approaches can be made. Nevertheless, we have distinguished between several approaches here. While there are many overlaps among them, in our view they can still be differentiated based on their distinct emphases. This classification is intended to serve as an orientation. For the approaches within the post-growth framework, we follow Schmelzer and Vetter (2023).\nBelow you will find a list of different approaches within sustainable economics and corresponding material for each approach. Please choose two of the following approaches. Work through the material for each approach. On Mural you will find question regarding the approaches. Try to answer the questions for the approaches you have chosen. This way you can gain an overview of the different approaches based on the work of other students. The lecturers will regularly check the Mural board and delete statements that are strongly incorrect or misleading, however, the lecturers will not correct every answer provided by the students.",

    "section": "7.2 ID/TD methods",
    "text": "7.2 ID/TD methods\nAt present, there is a considerable array of distinct ID/TD methodologies, derived from both research and practice. The objective of this section is not to present a comprehensive account of applied methods; rather, it aims to offer insights into a select number of methods. However, before we start to explore ID/TD methods, it is essential to acknowledge that a vast variety of scientific methods are used. Various scientific methods offer specific approaches to analysing the objects of investigation and are considered complementary, as they provide different approaches to description and explanation. The choice of method therefore depends heavily on the research question and the object of investigation (cf. Schirmer 2009, 129ff). The range of scientific methods is huge, making it difficult to categorise them. Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) used semi-structured interviews with scientists to ask about their understanding of the frequently used categorisation into quantitative and qualitative research. It is important to note here that the categorisation into quantitative and qualitative methods is made particularly in the social sciences - as Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) show. In some disciplines, researchers only conduct a certain type of research and never need anything other than clear ‘quantitative’ definitions (e.g. mathematical sciences); others only conduct research that involves texts but not numbers (e.g. literary studies). Further, some researchers considered how certain aspects lie outside the ‘qualitative’ or ‘quantitative’ (e.g. the ‘theoretical’ in German studies), or they conducted research that they considered to contain no ‘knowledge’ (sculpture in the visual arts), while others conducted basic ‘conceptual’ research that they considered to be at a stage prior to any quantity or quality judgement (philosophy). Finally, some researchers considered the terms to be of little relevance to their specialisms.\nIn many cases, the problems and issues in sustainability science require integrative, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in addition to human and natural science methods. By definition, interdisciplinary science, as sustainability science is, positions itself across the disciplines. For them, translations between disciplines are important. And when transdisciplinary approaches enter the respective social field and thus dissolve the disciplinary institutional distance, this must also have methodological consequences: It is about more inductive approaches in which the multiplicity of positions and approaches is recognised (Berger 2010). Collaboration in heterogeneous groups with experts and stakeholders (from science and/or practice) creates a mutual learning and research process, as all those involved can contribute their specific experience, knowledge and disciplinary methods to the project. In this way, existing methods are sometimes recombined and reimplemented.\nInterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods are characterised by the fact that they support the integration of different knowledge and enable co-creative processes for the development of sustainability contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring methods\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the wide variety of applied ID/TD methods, we won’t be able to demonstrate everything in our study programme. Therefore, you can also explore some ID/TD methods yourself:\n\nExplore the td-net Toolbox and read through the presented methods. We recommend reading the tools “actor constellation”, “three types of knowledge tool”, and “Theory of Change”. Feel free to read through further methods/tools.\nWe recommend to read the chapters “Citizen Science” and “Indigenous Knowledge” from the “Handbook Transdisciplinary Learning” (Philipp and Schmohl 2023).

    "section": "1.2 Economics and value judgments",
    "text": "1.2 Economics and value judgments\nMany economists — perhaps even the majority — hold that economic theory should be free from assumptions about human behavior, societal structures, and normative values. Economic theory should therefore be neutral and free of values and capable of formulating universally valid laws. According to this view, economics is regarded as a positive science. A positive science describes the world as it is, without making value judgments or taking a particular perspective. Typically, natural sciences are understood as positive sciences. Accordingly, mainstream economics distinguishes between positive statements (how the world is) and normative statements (how the world should be) and argues that these spheres are clearly separable (the fundamental philosophical position lies in logical positivism). The focus is accordingly on positive statements.\nCritics argue that such a clear distinction between positive and normative statements, between facts and values, is not possible for social sciences such as economics and therefore makes objective and value-free analysis impossible (see, for example, Davis 2016). Hilary Putnam argues that facts and values are often not clearly separable but intertwined (Putnam (2002)). Thus, economic concepts and theories are always shaped by values and worldviews in their construction.\nFollowing the critics we hold it to be difficult — if not impossible — to draw a clear line between positive and normative perspectives. The different ways in which economics can be defined show that value judgments are always implicit. One perspective may focus on the efficient allocation of scarce re-sources in a society, while another may focus on overcoming poverty and meeting the basic needs of all people in an economy. As soon as I favor one perspective over another, I have made an initial value judgment. In module 3, we take a closer look at the implicit value judgments of neoclassical economics, which sees itself as positive economics.\nAcknowledging that economics is not entirely value-free or objective does not mean rejecting the existence of facts or treating all viewpoints as equally valid. Nor does it deny the existence of an objective reality — it simply recognizes that we can only approximate it to varying degrees.\nLike any other science, economics must be guided by scientific principles and methods. In addition, assumptions and value judgments should be made explicit and transparent. In addition to criticism of the implicit value judgments behind neoclassical economics, the explicit framework of assumptions also leads to controversial discussions, particularly regarding the extent to which the assumptions must realistically reflect reality. Must the initial assumptions, such as the existence of perfect competition, be realistic in order to gain valuable insights? At first glance, the answer is clear: unrealistic or incomplete assumptions must also lead to false conclusions. According to the Paul Samuelson (1915-2009), one of the most famous economists of the 20th century, it is impossible to draw true conclusions from demonstrably false assumptions. However, proponents of so-called instrumentalism argue differently. They say that, given the complexity of human behavior, it is necessary to abstract and leave out the insignificant in analysis. In his search for an efficient method to discover far-reaching insights and recommendations for action, US economist Milton Friedman, also one of the most famous economists of the 20th century, even takes an extreme anti-realist position. Working within the framework of a superficial world is declared an unproblematic necessity:\n\n“Truly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have assumptions that are widely inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and in general the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumption. […] To be important, therefore, a hypothesis must be descriptively false in its assumptions.” - Milton Friedman, 1953, p. 14.\n\nThe debate as to whether economics is free of value judgements or not has been ongoing since the development of mainstream economics, neoclassical economics, towards the end of the 19th century and continues to this day, with no conclusive resolution. This is exemplified by two quotes from two well-known economists of the first half of the 20th century:\n\n“Economics deals with ascertainable facts; ethics with valuations and obligations. The two fields of inquiry are not on the same plane of discourse.” - Lionel Robbins in An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science (1932), p. 132.\n\n\n“As against Robbins, economics is essentially a moral science. That is to say, it employs introspection and judgment of value.” — John M. Keynes in a letter to Sir Roy Harrod, July 4, 1938, in Atkinson (2009), p. 791.\n\n\n1.2.1 What does this mean for economic policy?\nEconomic conclusions — like economic analyses — can never be made entirely free of value judgments. For example, when certain processes produce gains for some economic actors and losses for others, it is impossible to assess the overall net effect without introducing normative assumptions. Even appealing to pure economic efficiency already reflects a value judgment: it prioritizes efficiency over other possible criteria for evaluating outcomes. At first glance, it might seem reasonable to treat gains and losses equally — adding them up on a one-to-one basis without weighting. However, this approach assumes that all outcomes are of equal significance to those affected. In practice, this is rarely the case. Some individuals may experience losses that push them into an existential crisis—for instance, if their income drops below the threshold of physical or cultural subsistence. Depending on one’s ethical perspective, there may be strong reasons to argue that such losses should be weighted more heavily than the corresponding gains of others. Not applying any weighting at all is itself a normative choice. If we allow weights to vary continuously, then in principle, there are infinitely many possible normative positions one can take when evaluating such outcomes.\nWhen assessing such market processes, normative questions arise that economics, like any other social science with its empirical methods, is unable to answer objectively and value-free. It must therefore present these questions in such a way that they can be discussed by society and, if necessary, decided by parliaments through legislation.",

    "section": "1.3 Thought styles and thought collectives",
    "text": "1.3 Thought styles and thought collectives\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, economic theories are always shaped by value judgments and underlying worldviews. Therefore, there is no clearly objective economic theory, but rather a multitude of perspectives that make it possible to analyze and describe economic phenomena. There is no neutral “view from nowhere” or purely objective perspective, as our perception is shaped by numerous influences, such as our education, social and cultural environment, language, material living conditions, and personal experiences. These influences shape our perspective of the world. A helpful metaphor is that of glasses: some lenses allow us to see broad patterns, while others reveal fine details and nuances. These different “glasses” influence how we see the world — not arbitrarily, but within identifiable limits. As discussed earlier, multiperspectivity has boundaries; not every interpretation is equally valid or supported by evidence.\nIn the philosophy of science, such perspectives are often referred to as paradigms or thought styles. The concept of “thought style” (Denkstil) was developed by Ludwik Fleck, a Polish physician and philosopher of science, decades before Thomas Kuhn introduced the more widely known idea of paradigms. Fleck, born in 1896 in Poland and died in 1961 in Israel. In 1944 he was deported to the concentration camp Buchenwald. He was tasked with developing a typhus vaccine for the SS. However, he reportedly administered placebos to the guards and gave the actual medicine to fellow prisoners.\nIn his scientific work, Fleck emphasized the dependence of thinking on values and contexts. He rejected the idea that knowledge is objective, neutral, and universal. He argued that the production and use of knowledge take place in specific environments, which influences its meaning and effect. Knowledge is used differently in concentration camps than in NGOs or corporate research departments. Knowledge is always embedded in institutions and power structures, and scientists are influenced by their environment and previous experiences.\nThought collectives are groups of people who share a common way of thinking and use certain concepts and methods. Thought collectives therefore use a specific lens through which to view the world. These thought collectives are often conservative and resistant to change, i.e., they resist changes and further developments in their way of thinking. Since, as Fleck emphasized, people can think, argue, and understand in fundamentally different ways, people who belong to different thought collectives often have difficulty understanding the thought processes of other thought styles.\nFleck’s findings show that science and reasoning are by no means independent of social, cultural, and historical contexts. They illustrate the diversity of perspectives from which scientific problems can be viewed and emphasize that no single theory or way of thinking can fully capture the whole of reality. Instead, different thought styles and thought collectives are capable of providing diverse insights and enriching our understanding of complex phenomena. This leads to different economic policy recommendations and offers a wide range of approaches to solving complex challenges.\n\n1.3.1 Thought collective in economics\nAs already indicated several times, economics also consists of a multitude of different thought collectives that adopt certain perspectives or ways of thinking based on value judgments and worldviews. This diversity of thought collectives (often referred to as schools of thought) is described by the term “pluralist economics.” At present, economics is strongly dominated by one thought style known as neoclassical economics, which is often described as mainstream economics. However, we believe that students should not only learn about the thought style of the prevailing thought collective but also gain an insight into how thought styles in economics have developed and what other thought styles exist in economics. The next chapter provides an introduction to the history and development of thought styles in economics. We will then deal with current schools of thought in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther readings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYuval Harari and the legend of Peugeot in his book “A brief history of humankind” His thesis: The truly sufficient difference between us and other animals is our ability to create cooperative net-works in which millions of complete strangers work together toward common goals. We can co-operate on a large scale because we follow shared intersubjective fictions. We work successfully with strangers because, like them, we believe in things such as gods, nations, money, or human rights. And yet none of these things exist outside the stories that humans invent and tell each other. There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, and no human rights—except in the collective imagination of humans.\nPodcast with Yuval Harari on the topic of “trickle-down economics”: What is the trick in trickle down?\nIt’s how wealthy elites and their neoliberal lackeys convince you that what’s good for them (tax cuts, deregulation, etc.) is good for you… and that policies like the minimum wage, overtime, and paid sick leave will ruin the economy. Economics is a story we tell ourselves to help explain who gets what, and why. In this episode, we explore how to tell a better story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBontrup, Heinz-J., and Ralf-M. Marquardt. 2021.

    "section": "3.2 (Re-)production factors",
    "text": "3.2 (Re-)production factors\nProduction factors are all the factors that are necessary as inputs for the production of an output, a good or a service. The aggregate production factors of an economy are described as factor endowment. The origins of production factors can be found in 18th-century physiocratic thinking, and they became established as a concept in classical economics. According to classical economics, the factors of production can be divided into three categories: land, capital, and labor. Over time, this trinity has been repeatedly criticized, expanded, and adapted. For example, entrepreneurship, knowledge & technology, and nature itself have been brought into play as additional factors. However, these aspects are often subsumed under one of the three original production factors.\nIn addition to neglecting other factors, this understanding is also criticized for overemphasizing the sphere of production over reproduction and maintenance, or for neglecting reproduction and maintenance and only considering them when they are sold as services (commodified). For example, a simple cup in your household is produced only once but then has to be washed a thousand times. Infrastructure and objects must be constantly repaired and maintained. And workers must also be cared and provided for, i.e., reproduced.\n\n3.2.1 Land\nThe term “land” refers to natural resources used for production. These include resources such as farmland, mineral resources, and water. Companies must pay land rent (such as emission certificates or concessions for hydroelectric power plants) for the use of land, which is a scarce production factor. In some cases, natural capital is still regarded as a “pure input factor” or “only an input factor” regardless of its comprehensive life-sustaining functions, and is taken for granted. For example, a forest is reduced to its purely economically exploitable dimension, such as the sale of wood and game. It is also often neglected that nature is never available in the form of goods, but must always be made usable and economically exploitable by humans through work (Schaupp (2024)).\n\n\n3.2.2 Capital\nCompanies acquire capital factors through investment. They do this either by using surpluses from previous production periods or by taking on loans. Capital factors include machinery, tools, buildings, and other tangible capital. Monetary capital only becomes a factor of production when it is converted into tangible capital.\n\n\n3.2.3 Labor\nLabor is the third factor of production and is necessary for raw materials to be turned into goods and services. Coordinating, intellectual, and executive activities are necessary for the targeted use of capital in order to be able to produce. As already mentioned at the beginning, care work is neglected here. This is especially true when this work is unpaid. In classical and neoclassical economics, the focus is strongly on paid work, while unpaid reproductive work is taken for granted.\nThe analysis usually only records and considers statistics on paid work. The unemployment rate is generally used as the most important indicator. This is usually calculated as follows:\n\\[unemployment\\,rate = \\frac{number\\,of\\,registered\\,unemployed}{labour\\,force} \\]\nHowever, this indicator is only one of several indicators that are used. The International Labour Organization (ILO) works with a different notion of unemployment (in German Erwerbslosigkeit) . From this perspective, all permanent residents in Switzerland who are without work, are looking for work, and could start work within a short period of time are considered unemployed. In 2024, the unemployment rate in Switzerland averaged 2.4%, and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate according to the ILO was 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Unlike the official unemployment rate, the unemployment rate according to the ILO also includes, for example, self-employed persons, persons affected by long-term unemployment such as those who have exhausted their unemployment benefits, and young people who are not yet in employment immediately after completing their education. Accordingly, the ILO unemployment rate is higher than the official unemployment rate. However, such indicators say nothing about the type of employment and working conditions, which means they are not useful for such assessments. More fundamental questions about the meaning and purpose of work and a high employment target cannot be discussed using such indicators.\nThe following figure shows the development of the official unemployment rate in Switzerland since 1920. Unemployment in Switzerland has always been very low by international standards. During the post-war economic boom in particular, there was almost no unemployment in Switzerland, which is why the country attracted many workers from abroad – who often worked in precarious conditions. It was not until the crisis of the 1970s that unemployment returned to Switzerland, although the country prevented a sharp rise by exporting unemployment abroad – by 1977, almost 250,000 foreign workers had to leave the country (Degen (2012), p. 910).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: 1920-1996 Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland; 1997-2019 Seco\n\n\n\nSince 1997, the FSO (Federal Statistical Office) has been recording the monetary value and quantity of unpaid work in Switzerland every four years using the satellite account for household production (SHHP).

    "text": "3.3 The marginal principle – marginal utility and marginal costs\nBefore we look at the form of provisioning of market exchange, we will focus on the marginal principle. This is central to the conception of the market, as it provides an explanation for the formation of value and utility and thus demand. The marginal principle has its origins in the emergence of neoclassical economics around 1870 and still forms the basis of neoclassical economics today. It deals with the question of the value of goods, thereby also influencing the allocation of goods, services, and factors of production. In contrast to classical economics, the neoclassical marginal principle departs from the objective theory of value and formulates the subjective theory of value.\nThe objective theory of value in classical economics postulates that all goods have an objective value. The labor invested in the production of goods was commonly used as the basis for determining this value, which gave rise to the labor theory of value. In subjective theory of value, on the other hand, no absolute values are considered, but rather the subjective values that people ascribe to goods and their marginal changes in relation to the initial situation. This focus on marginal changes forms the basis of the marginal principle. The marginal principle enabled differential calculus to be applied to cost/benefit and revenue functions, which led to the sustained rise of mathematical models in economics.\n\n3.3.1 Revenue function of land and marginal revenue\nThe marginal principle was originally observed in the revenue function of land. Studies of agriculture in the 18th century revealed the relationship between factor input and revenue (originally yield in agricultural production). Marginal revenue is the increase in yield resulting from an additional unit of a production factor.\n\n“It is in the nature of agriculture – and this is a very noteworthy circumstance – that the increase in production does not rise in direct proportion to the number of workers employed, but that each worker employed later produces less than the previous one.” - Johann Heinrich von Thünen, Der isolirte Staat, 1850. Quoted in Winfried Reiss, Mikroökonomische Theorie: Historisch fundierte Einführung, 2007,p.90, own translation\n\nWhat von Thünen observed with the factor of labor was also noted by A.R.J. Turgot with the use of the factor of capital in the form of fertilizer. The principle of marginal productivity can also be applied to industrial production and, for example, to the number of workers in a factory.\n\n\n3.3.2 Gossen’s laws\nIn 1854, Hermann Heinrich Gossen developed his laws of human interatctions and the rules for human behavior that follow from them. In them, he formulated the regularity of individual preferences and their satisfaction, which is based on the respective utility.\n\n3.3.2.1 Gossen’s first law: the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility, also known as the law of diminishing marginal utility, states:\n\n“The magnitude of one and the same pleasure diminishes continuously as we continue to enjoy it, until finally saturation is reached.”\n\n\nHermann Heinrich Gossen, Entwickelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs, und der daraus fliessenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln, Braunschweig 1854,p.4, own translation.\n\nThus, the utility of the first cup of coffee in the morning is greater than that of the third or fourth. The same applies to living space, where, for example, the first bathroom in an apartment is of greater utili-ty to the residents than the second. According to the theory, this law can be applied to all goods.\n\n\n3.3.2.2 Gossen’s second law: the Law of Equi-marginal Utility\nThe law of equal marginal utility, also known as the law of equi-mariginal utility, states:\n\n“A person who is free to choose between several pleasures but does not have enough time to enjoy them all to the fullest, must, however different the absolute magnitude of the individual pleasures may be, in order to maximize the sum of his pleasure, before he fully prepares even the greatest of them, prepare them all partially, and in such a proportion that the magnitude of each pleasure remains the same for all at the moment when its preparation is interrupted.”\n\n\nHermann Heinrich Gossen in Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs, und der daraus fliessenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln 1854, p.12, own translation\n\nThis law aims at the optimal use of limited resources for various goods. The optimal utility for an individual is achieved when the marginal utility (i.e., the utility of the next additional unit) is the same for all goods. Mathematically, this means that the marginal utility functions of the various goods are equated. The marginal utility corresponds to the maximum price that the person in question is willing to pay. The aggregate demand (function) can be determined by aggregating the marginal utility (functions) of all individuals. The marginal principle thus forms the core of neoclassical consumption theory. For interested students (who are familiar with the basics of neoclassical economics), we recommend a critical discussion of neoclassical consumption theory by Ben Fine.\nMarginal costs and marginal revenue in companies As derived above, marginal revenue describes the revenue from an additional unit. Similarly, the term marginal cost describes the cost of an additional unit. Marginal costs can be determined by deriving the mathematical cost function. The costs [C] of a company are the sum of the fixed costs [Cf] (e.g., rent, machinery) and the variable costs [Cv] (labor, raw materials, intermediate products).\n\\[ C = C_f+C_V \\]\nAccording to neoclassical theory, companies are guided not only by the cost function but also by the revenue function. This describes how much revenue [R] is generated from the sale of a good depend-ing on quantity [Q] and price [P]. Deriving the revenue function yields the marginal revenue, which is the revenue from an additional unit sold.\n\\[ R = Q * P \\]\nA company produces until the marginal costs exceed the marginal revenues. This can be calculated by equating the derivatives of the cost and revenue functions. In market equilibrium (under perfect com-petition), theoretically the price corresponds to the marginal costs. Although neoclassical theory focuses heavily on the price, it has paid little attention to how companies set prices. In his dissertation, Nubbemeyer (2010) shows that until the middle of the 20th century, there was a controversial debate about whether companies actually base their pricing on the marginal principle or on alternative concepts (e.g., mark-up pricing as in some post-Keynesian models). Although the debate was not conclusively resolved, the marginal principle prevailed with the advent of neoclassical economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many employees does a company hire according to the marginal principle?\nAccording to theory, what determines the level of employees’ wages?\nWhat does this mean for involuntary unemployment?

    "section": "3.4 How the market works",
    "text": "3.4 How the market works\nAs described above, in neoclassical economics, i.e., mainstream economics, the market is regarded as the central institution for the provision of goods and services. We will therefore take a closer look at how the market is conceptualized in neoclassical economics.\n\n3.4.1 The market as a central coordinating authority\nIn markets, supply and demand meet and serve as the basis for the price mechanism. Supply is the willingness of an actor to offer goods, services, or factors, and demand is the willingness to purchase them. The utility functions of the actors, which can be calculated on the basis of the marginal principle, form the basis for demand. Aggregate demand is the sum of the individual utility functions.\nIn economics, markets are usually represented by price-quantity diagrams. The axes represent quantity and price (or wages in labor markets and interest rates in capital markets), while supply and demand are represented by curves. The slope of the curves changes with the elasticity of supply and demand and shows how strongly they change when quantity or price changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Graphical representation and determination of a market equilibrium\n\n\n\nIf the supply of a good is too high, the price falls; if demand is too high, the price rises. In market equilibrium, demand equals supply and the price stabilizes. The price mechanism thus determines who produces what, how much is produced, and for whom. The price is therefore regarded as the central allocation instrument in markets. For example, a factory that produces with outdated machinery cannot produce at the same price as another factory with more modern equipment. Due to the high production costs, it is forced out of the market and must produce other goods or file for bankruptcy. A central assumption for the supply curve to have an upward slope is that above a certain size the marginal costs of companies rise again (even in the long term), for example due to increased coordination costs, meaning that there is a limit to growth for companies. However, this assumption is controversial (see, for example, Keen 2010, Pirgmeier 2017). If this assumption is not fulfilled, the supply curve could also have a different slope and there would be no guaranteed market equilibrium with many competitive companies, but rather a tendency toward monopoly. Even Alfred Marshall, the founder of this price-quantity diagram, repeatedly struggled with the question of whether there could also be a tendency toward monopoly (Marshall (1919), p. 316; Marshall (1919), p. 324).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief digression: Price level)\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the importance of the price mechanism for the functioning of markets, the price level in an economy is one of the most important variables to be observed and analyzed. Price stability is measured by the inflation rate (rate of price increases) of goods and services. Low inflation of up to 2% is considered a stable price level. Statistical offices use a standardized “basket of goods” to record how the price index of the cost of living changes over time. If the price level falls, this is referred to as deflation. The composition of the basket of goods varies from country to country and usually covers only markets for goods, but not capital markets.\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) compiles the National Consumer Price Index (CPI). The figure below shows the consumer goods that make up this index and their respective shares. The basket of goods contains “the most important goods and services consumed by private households.” The weighting is based on annual household surveys and is intended to reflect actual consumption patterns as accurately as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Composition of the basket of goods for the national consumer price index 2023 (Federal Statistical Office, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.1 The invisible hand of the market\nThe term “invisible hand” is often used to describe the self-regulation of markets. The term was coined by Adam Smith. Adam Smith used the term twice in his earlier work “The Theory of Moral Sentiments” (1759) and once in his work “The Wealth of Nations” (1776). In “The Wealth of Nations,” Smith uses the term in the chapter on “Of Restraints upon the Importation from Foreign Countries of such Goods as can be Produced at Home”. In this context, Smith writes that if someone prefers to support the national economy instead of the foreign economy, that person is guided by an invisible hand. Noam Chomsky therefore interprets Smith as describing a “home bias” in this passage. However, various economists have interpreted the passage differently. The most popular interpretation sees this passage as establishing the self-regulating forces of the market. Market forces are a regulating force that leads individuals to satisfy their individual needs in the best possible way, which at the same time serves society by distributing goods in the best possible way. Such an interpretation is controversial in view of the surrounding context and is repeatedly criticized by experts in the history of economic thought.\n\n“As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He gener-ally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.”\n\n\nSmith, Adam. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Edited by Edwin Cannan. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976.\n\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Perfect competition\nA basic prerequisite for the functioning of markets is that of perfect competition. In perfect competition, individual suppliers have no influence on the price, because if the price increases, consumers will buy from other suppliers. Companies must accept the market price as a given and can only decide on the quantity they offer. They are therefore in the role of price takers and quantity adjusters.\nFor a market to be considered perfectly competitive, several conditions must be met:\n\nLarge mumber of Market participants: There must be many suppliers and consumers. This structure is referred to as a polypoly (in German “Polypol”, however, in English usually just referred to as perfect competition). In contrast, a market with only a few suppliers or consumers is called an oligopoly (few suppliers) or oligopsony (few consumers). If there is only one supplier or consumer, the market is a monopoly or monopsony, respectively (see diagram below for an overview).\nPerfect information: All participants must have full and equal access to relevant information. There should be no hidden agreements between market actors or undisclosed quality deficiencies in the goods offered.\nNo consumer preferences for specific suppliers: Consumers must be indifferent to which supplier they buy from. A perfectly competitive market requires that buyers can switch freely between suppliers. If consumers favor a specific supplier, that supplier could charge a price above the market rate without losing demand, which violates the condition of perfect competition.\n\nIf the above conditions are not met, there is a distortion of competition. In a neoclassical market economy, the state should intervene with regulations in such a situation.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Overview of the different market forms. Polypoly is a condition for the assumption of perfect competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\none buyer\nfew buyers\nmany buyers\n\n\n\n\nOne seller/supplier\nBilateral Monopoly\nLimited Supply Monopoly\nMonopoly\n\n\nFew sellers/suppliers\nRestricted Monopsony\nBilateral Oligopoly\nOligopoly\n\n\nMany sellers/suppliers\nMonopsony\nOligopsony\nPolypoly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Different types of markets\n\n\n\nThis market mechanism for coordinating supply and demand is applied to various markets. A fundamental distinction is made between goods markets and factor markets. Goods and services are traded on goods markets. On factor markets, the factors of production (land, capital, labor) are supplied and demanded. For example, households offer their labor on the labor market, and instead of a price, the demand from companies determines the level of wages paid through the price mechanism. Karl Polanyi describes how the introduction of factor markets led to the development of today’s “market society” and how social processes are increasingly aligning themselves with market logic (Polanyi (2017)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all three conditions of perfect competition, think of examples from today’s economy where these conditions are met and where they are not.\nAre there differences in the demand for different goods?

    "text": "3.5 Economic actors\nEconomic activity is shaped by various actors. They all have different roles, interests, and possibilities for action. Such actors include companies, households, the state, civil society, financial institutions, etc. Different degrees of complexity or perspectives mean that more or fewer of these actors are included in the analysis. And depending on how the economy is conceptualized, the roles of the actors and how they interact with each other also change. The circular flow analysis is the most common concept of economic activity, but there are many different variants.\n\n3.5.1 Circular flow analysis\nIn the circular flow analysis, which dates back to François Quesnay (1694-1774), economic activities are recorded as flows of goods and money between different actors and represented graphically. The main actors are households and companies, and in more complex representations, the state, banks, and foreign countries are also included. The graphical representation of economic processes serves to simplify the modeling of theoretical assumptions.\nIn a simple circular flow of the economy, households and companies are linked. The former provide the latter with their labor in exchange for wages. Using labor and other factors of production, companies produce goods and services that households consume.\nIn a circular flow of the economy, expenditure always equals income at an aggregate level. Households receive wages (W) and can consume these again as expenditure (C). Companies receive profits (P) and spend these again in the form of investment (I).\n\\[ Revenue = Expenditure \\] \\[ W+P = C+I \\]\n This simple circular flow can be extended to illustrate more complex relationships by adding other actors.\nBy describing economic relationships, circular flow analysis makes it possible to explain and predict phenomena. It also provides a basis for economic policy measures based on systematic investigations of economic relationships, connections, and regularities.\nIn most conventional circular flow analyses, only the market economy is represented as a producing and value-creating entity. Households are merely portrayed as consumers. Unpaid work and (re)production that take place outside the sphere of the market economy are thus systematically neglected and devalued. Feminist economics has formulated this criticism and has dealt extensively with alternative concepts. Diane Elson’s circular flow model serves as an illustration here. If you are interested, you can explore the perspective of feminist economics in more depth in section 4 on pluralist economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Circular flow model according to Diane Elson 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens in the simple circular flow model when total economic expenditure remains the same and corporate profits rise at the same time?\nHow does falling consumer spending affect the economy in this model?\nHow does Elson’s circular model differ from the two models shown above?

    "section": "1.1 Subfield of economics",
    "text": "1.1 Subfield of economics\nEconomics can be divided into three major subfields: economic theory, economic policy, and public finance. There are different ways to divide the field of economics, but using these three categories is a helpful way to get an overview. For our purposes, the first two — economic theory and economic policy — are especially important.\n\nEconomic theory describes theories from the past to the present and highlights their implications for how the economy is described and evaluated. There are many different schools of thought within economic theory (these are discussed in more detail in the learning sequence on pluralist economics). In principle, all schools of thought can be divided into two sub-areas of economic theory: microeconomics and macroeconomics.\n\nMicroeconomics deals with individual economic entities, such as households and companies, and their mutual relationships. It does not make any statements about aggregate economic relationships but rather examines the behavior of individual companies and households and their coordination process via the market with the help of price adjustments (Bontrup and Marquardt (2021), p. 1).\nIn contrast, Macroeconomics deals with the aggregate economic relationships between economic sectors and different markets and examines macroeconomic phenomena. For example, it examines macroeconomic indicators such as the unemployment rate or inflation.\n\nPublic finance examines the various components of the national budget, such as taxes and subsidies, and their interrelationships. This implicitly raises questions about the role of the state in resource allocation and the distribution of income and wealth.\nEconomic policy deals with state intervention in the economy. It is concerned with shaping social life in order to increase social welfare (Bontrup and Marquardt (2021), p. 2). However, views on what constitutes social welfare can vary greatly. The state has a significant influence on how economic actors interact, for example, but not exclusively through targeted interventions. The targets of economic policy can include employment, price stability, foreign trade, economic growth, the distribution of income or wealth, and the protection of the natural environment. Examples of economic policy interventions include the prohibition of cartels or the introduction of a minimum wage.\nEconomic history is another important subfield, focusing on economic policy and dynamics over extended timeframes or through a historical lens. One possible subject of investigation could be the effectiveness of economic policy during the Great Depression. The historical development of economic theories is examined in the context of the history of economic thought.\nIn addition, there are various specialized fields within economics, such as behavioral economics, education economics, and health economics, each focusing on a specific area of inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther readings\n\n\n\n\n\nHa-Joon Chang’s book “Economics: The User’s Guide” offers an easy introduction to topics in economics, provides a historical perspective and a good overview of past and current debates. Depending on your interests, individual chapters can also be consulted.\nChang, Ha-Joon. 2014. Economics: The User’s Guide. First U.S. edition. New York: Bloomsbury Press.",

    "section": "3.6 Division of labor",
    "text": "3.6 Division of labor\nAlongside the invisible hand, Adam Smith’s needle factory is probably the best-known excerpt from his work. The first chapter deals with the division of labor in a needle factory and how this greatly increases productivity. Based on this, Adam Smith makes a more general observation about how the division of labor increases productivity. Individuals, companies, or countries that specialize in a particular activity can perform it increasingly better. This gives them an absolute advantage in production over others. Economic entities increasingly specialize in those areas in which they are better than others. If an entity is not superior to another in any area, it cannot participate in activities around market exchange.\nDavid Ricardo later criticizes Smith’s theory of absolute advantages. According to Smith, if one economic entity were superior to another in all respects, it would produce everything itself. Ricardo, on the other hand, established the theory of comparative advantage. This states that entities produce those goods in which they have the greatest relative advantage or the least relative disadvantage compared to others. In this case, it still makes sense for entities that are not superior to others in any activity to participate in a common economy. In doing so, they take on tasks for which others are better qualified but do not prioritize due to a lack of resources.\nExample: Ricardo illustrated his theory using the example of trade (cloth and wine) between England and Portugal, aiming to show that free trade would be beneficial for both sides. It was a plea against the import restrictions and tariffs between countries that were prevalent at the time and based on mercantilist logic. This short video illustrates the basic idea behind Ricardo’s theory of comparative cost advantages:\n\nRicardo is often cited to illustrate that free trade is beneficial for all countries involved. Although widespread, this perspective should be viewed critically. For one thing, the term “free trade” quickly loses its meaning in the context of European imperialism, which was emerging at the time Ricardo developed his theory. During this period, the global market was shaped by the prevailing power relations, primarily to the advantage of the Global North. It was based on the exploitation of the Global South and created unequal structures, some of which persist to this day (see, for example, Anievas and Nişancioğlu (2015), Davis (2017), Ghosh (2021), Hickel (2017)). In addition, advantageous participation in global trade requires a country to have competitive industries. Western Europe and the US also built up their industries under the protection from the global market and with industrial policies (Chang (2002)). The forced economic opening of many countries in the Global South from the end of the 1970s onwards by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund made it difficult for them to develop their own competitive manufacturing industries and pushed them back into the production or extraction of raw materials (see, for example, Palma (2003)). Dorninger et al. 2021 show how strongly this unequal exchange manifests and materializes in various aspects (e.g., land use, resource consumption, etc.).\n\n3.6.1 Types of division of labor\nFrom an economic perspective, division of labor can be divided into three main types: intra-company division of labor, inter-company division of labor, and international division of labor.\nIntra-company division of labor describes the division of tasks within a company that was prevalent in the course of industrialization. Mass production in factories replaced serial production in manufactories. According to Taylorist (after Frederick W. Taylor, 1856-1915) and Fordist (after Henry Ford) principles, work was divided into small, repetitive steps. Workers were no longer responsible for manufacturing an entire product, but only for a small step along the assembly line.\nIn the inter-company division of labor, production processes are distributed across economic actors. An example of this is the spread of supplier companies, which can produce intermediate products (e.g., semiconductors) more cheaply for other companies due to their specialization.\nFinally, the international division of labor describes the division of labor at the global level. With the increase in globalization since the 1980s, the interdependence of the global economy has steadily grown. In addition, the division of labor is increasingly taking place along the value chains of individual goods and not just between goods. A separate field of research has developed on such global value chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider two advantages and two disadvantages of the division of labor at the company, inter-company, and international levels.\nDo you know of any specific examples of national specialization? Research how this specialization was implemented.\nWhat could be the disadvantages or risks of international division of labor?",

    "text": "3.7 Categories of goods\nGoods are all things and services that have been made usable from nature or produced by humans to satisfy needs. Their various characteristics and the social structures surrounding them significantly influence how different actors interact with them and how their use is regulated.\n\n3.7.1 Good characteristics\nWe categorize goods depending on whether or not people can be prevented from consuming them (excludability) and whether or not they can consume them without affecting their availability to other individuals (rivalry).\nAll goods can be divided into one of four types based on these two characteristics of rivalry and exclusivity.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Overview of types of goods based on the characteristics of rivalry and exclusivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\nrival in use\nnon-rival in use\n\n\n\n\nexcludable use\nPrivate goods\nbread apartment clothing\nClub goods\ncable television streaming services national park\n\n\nnon-excludable use\nCommon goods\nhigh seas fishing grounds Gotthard road tunnel on the Easter weekend\nPublic goods\nlegal system waterway corrections fireworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate goods are both excludable and rival in consumption. This means that it is possible to prevent people from consuming them through measures and that the consumption of a good cannot be repeated by any number of people. Because of these characteristics, private goods are characterized as good for market exchanges.\nClub goods are excludable but non-rival in consumption. For example, cable television or streaming platforms can exclude people from consumption in the form of a subscription fee, but do not suffer if the number of users increases. Outside the realm of digital goods, the distinction between private and club goods is more difficult to make. For example, membership in a fitness club and use of the associated facilities is only non-rival until January, when all users want to pursue their New Year’s resolutions and all equipment is fully utilized.\nCommon goods are non-excludable but rival in consumption. These often include natural resources such as fish stocks or the availability of water for irrigating fields. Coordination between the various users is essential to prevent overuse of these goods.\nPublic goods are neither excludable nor rival in consumption. Such goods are hardly tradable on markets due to their non-excludability. The use of public goods without paying for them is described as the free rider problem. However, such necessary goods can still be provided through government funding.\nHowever, the classification of these goods is not a natural one. Excludability in particular is not an inherent characteristic of a good, but depends primarily on technical possibilities, social negotiation, and social power relations. When dealing with natural resources in particular, the question of exclusivity is primarily a social and/or technical one. Water resources, for example, can be made technically accessible without any problems, but they can also be made exclusive. Even sunlight could theoretically be made exclusive, as Mr. Burns plans to do in the TV series “The Simpsons.” From his point of view, the sun is the enemy.\nWhen categorizing goods, it is also important to note that this involves a process of reification. Goods are reduced to their purely economic value. This can be very problematic, especially for resources that are managed as common goods (also known as commons). It often obscures how commons structure social relationships and communities, enable participation, and maintain a relationship with nature and the environment. Ugo Mattei therefore argues that it is simplistic to say that we “have” a common good. Rather, it is a question of exploring the extent to which we “are” commons, insofar as we are also part of the environment (Mattei 2014, p. 76). For this reason, social anthropology, for example, often uses the verb “commoning” instead of the noun “commons.”\nThe tragedy of the commons\nActors cannot be excluded from consuming public and common goods. This can result in overuse of these goods, which was described by Garret Hardin in 1968 as the tragedy of the commons. Privatization of these goods (known as enclosure) is often proposed as a solution; whereby clear property rights can be assigned to exclude actors from use.\n\nElinor Ostrom researched the same topic and observed how self-organized cooperation within clear boundaries can counteract overuse even without the allocation of property rights. However, effective solutions to the overuse of non-excludable goods are highly context-dependent and therefore difficult to generalize. Ostrom was awarded the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2009 for her research on the commons. The now extensive research on the commons includes many examples of commons that have not been overused and have not succumbed to tragedy. There are examples of commons that have been managed collectively and sustainably for centuries (see, for example, De Moor (2015); De Keyzer (2018)).\n\nThe commons research conducted by Ostrom and others shows that there are solutions beyond privatization and nationalization to prevent the tragedy of the commons. This also fundamentally breaks down the dichotomy between the market and the state and enables points of contact beyond these two spheres.\n\n\n3.7.2 External effects\nThe price paid for the use of goods does not always correspond to their true social cost. If the good is used at such a price anyway, the costs are passed on to third parties, i.e., neither to producers nor consumers, but to taxpayers, future generations, or nature, for example. When this happens, we speak of external effects. External effects can have a positive or negative impact on the production or consumption possibilities of third parties. In neoclassical economics, external costs are generally understood as an exception to an otherwise well-functioning market. In contrast, William Kapp pointed out as early as 1950 that the more a system is based on maximizing private profit, the greater the incentives to pass on costs to people, society, and nature (Kapp (1950)). Accordingly, the current capitalist system has inherent tendencies toward the externalization of costs. Anna Saave recently theorized this further (Saave (2022)). Stephan Lessenich describes affluent societies in the Global North as externalization societies that shift costs to the Global South (Lessenich (2020)).\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Overview of types of external effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect on…\n…production possibilities of third parties\nEffect on…\n…consumption possibilities of third parties\n\n\n\n\npositive effect\nApple growers and beekeepers benefit mutually from pollination and apple blossoms.\nParents have their children vaccinated -&gt; society benefits from lower infection rates and healthcare costs\n\n\nnegative effect\nIndustry emits pollutants into waterways -&gt; third parties can no longer fish\nIndustry emits pollutants into water -&gt; third parties can no longer swim in the river\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollect two examples of each of the four categories of goods that you encounter in everyday life.\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of privatizing common goods?

    "text": "3.8 Costs\n\n3.8.1 Cost types\nIf a company wants to provide a service, it has to pay its employees a wage. If a student goes out for a beer with friends after class, she cannot review the material she learned instead. And if farmers use too much fertilizer on their fields, the quality of the surrounding water will decline. Although different in different ways, in all of these scenarios costs occur. Costs are negative consequences that arise when creating value.\nProduction costs arise in the production of goods and services in companies when production factors are consumed for their creation. A distinction is often made between constant capital (machinery, tools) and variable capital (labor).\nMarginal costs describe the increase in costs caused by an additional unit produced. As described above, this parameter is used in combination with marginal revenue to assess the quantity to be produced.\nOpportunity costs are the costs of a lost utility that could have been obtained instead of the chosen use of the production factor or good. In the example above, the student decided to invest her time in social contacts instead of repeating the material. In this case, the opportunity costs is the utility that was not gained by repeating the material during this time. Since people always have different options for using their time, costs always arise according to the concept of opportunity costs. The famous saying “there is no such thing as a free lunch” means exactly that.\nTransaction costs are the costs incurred in the process of transactions. For example, when purchasing a piece of land, a buyer pays a notary for certification and other costs, such as a land registry entry, in addition to the price of the land.\nExternal costs arise when costs are not passed on to those who cause them (producers/consumers) but to third parties (society). Because these costs are not included in the true price of goods, they create incentives to consume the goods concerned in excessive quantities. External costs often take the form of environmental damage, as the value of nature is difficult to quantify.\n\n\n3.8.2 Cost-benefit analysis\nCost-benefit analysis makes it possible to weigh up the costs and benefits. This tool allows the expected consequences of decisions to be assessed by weighing up the associated costs and benefits. The important prerequisite for this analysis is the monetary valuation of all consequences. Only in this way can an assessment be made using comparable variables. The establishment of cost-benefit analysis dates back to the discussion of social costs (external costs) in the 1950s and 1960s. Based on the work of economists such as William Kapp (1950), it was argued that the resulting social costs should be prevented through regulation. Ronald Coase (1960), on the other hand, argued that regulations also represent costs for companies – opportunity costs due to lost profits. For example, the profit of a chemical company that pollutes a river through its activities. This profit must be offset against the social costs. According to Coase, such a total calculation provides a basis for arguing against regulation and for the expansion of property rights (i.e., the market).\nThe cost-benefit analysis has several problems. One difficulty is that the value of many areas of social and natural life cannot be clearly quantified with a price. For example, it is not possible to put a clear and objective price on an endangered animal or plant species, the existence of a forest, clean air, or a human life.\nTo meet this challenge, researchers have developed various methods to enable the quantification of monetary values. Two essential methods are important here:\nUsing stated preference methods, actors can be asked about various future scenarios. Previously unknown circumstances can thus be weighed against each other.\nIn revealed preference methods, a utility assessment for the future is derived from decisions that have already been made. This prevents actors from giving strategic answers when assessing expected future scenarios. However, conditions that have not previously occurred cannot be assessed.\nAlthough there are established methods for assessing preferences, these are limited in their ability to weigh up costs and benefits. As the term “preference” already suggests that these are always subjective views. The monetary assessment derived from them will therefore always be subjective, i.e., not an objective figure.\nExample: At the beginning of this millennium, it emerged that the tobacco company Philip Morris had commissioned a cost-benefit analysis of the effects of smoking on the Czech Republic. The authors concluded that smoking generated an annual profit of around 5.8 billion koruna (approx. USD 150 million) for the Czech state budget. Due to the lower life expectancy of smokers, the state had to provide for them for a shorter period of time and therefore saved money.\nThis report sparked a public outcry, prompting the tobacco company to apologize. But this example also highlights the subjective nature of cost-benefit analysis. By reducing the value of human life to a number, the company had not only crossed a moral line. As a scientist later showed, the company had also made false assumptions and omitted far-reaching costs in the report. Her cost-benefit analysis of the same scenario concluded that smoking in the Czech Republic contributed to an annual deficit of around 14 billion koruna.\nAnother problem is that a cost-benefit analysis implies that different types of capital are substitutable, i.e., that the loss of biodiversity can be replaced by technology. This assumption is controversial and is one of the central points of contention between different understandings of sustainability. We will return to this in module 5 in the discussion of strong and weak sustainability.\n\n\n3.8.3 Discounting – the factor of time\nThe factor of time is included in the cost-benefit analysis by means of discounting. Costs incurred in the future are valued at a lower level. The discount rate influences how much perceived costs decrease over time. Various decision-making criteria can be used to determine the discount rate. Intergenerational justice, the choice between strong and weak sustainability (introduced in section 6), uncertainty about future events, and the time preference of decision-makers influence how much future costs are discounted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Illustration of different discount rates over time\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows different discount rates over the same period. For example, the cost of climate damage of $1,000 occurring in 10 years is valued at approximately $860 at a discount rate of 1.5%. At a discount rate of 5%, only around $600 is included in the cost-benefit analysis as perceived costs. 10% discount rate value the $1,000 in 10 years at around $350 in the present.\nExample: In 2006, British economist Nicholas Stern published the Stern Report for the British government. In this comprehensive document, he describes climate change as the greatest market failure in history and uses cost-benefit analysis to argue that one percent (he later argued for two percent) of global GDP must be invested in reducing emissions.\nEconomists had mixed reactions to Stern’s report. While some supported him, others argued that he had miscalculated the costs of global warming. The main argument was his low discount rate of 0.1 percent, which he used to assess future costs. Economist William Nordhaus took Stern’s calculations and changed only the discount rate from 0.1% to 3%. According to this, investments to combat global warming are still necessary, but much lower than Stern demanded. In the logic of the cost/benefit analysis, Nordhaus concludes that, in the best-case scenario, global warming will rise to over 3 degrees by 2100 (Nordhaus (2019)).\nThe question of the discount rate represents a clear ethical position in this example. Stern chose a discount rate of 0.1%, assuming that the annual risk of human extinction is 0.1%. Otherwise, the welfare of future generations should be weighted exactly the same as today’s. Nordhaus’ discount rate, on the other hand, weights the welfare of future generations by 3% less each year. This is based on the assumption that the economy will continue to grow at this rate and that the costs will therefore be perceived as lower.\nThe calculation of future costs and benefits therefore depends on many assumptions and ethical questions. These are supposed to be reflected numerically in the discount rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider how the following decision-making principles affect the discount rate:\n\nIntergenerational justice\nHigh time preference (preference to consume goods in the present)",

    "section": "3.9 Prosperity in a Changing World",
    "text": "3.9 Prosperity in a Changing World\nIn our modern world, characterized by rapid change and a constantly growing population, the term “prosperity” is often associated with economic and monetary wealth. However, in times when environmental change, social inequality, and resource scarcity are becoming pressing challenges, this conventional view of prosperity is no longer sufficient. The complexity and multifaceted nature of the concept make it controversial. In addition, measuring prosperity is extremely difficult and therefore leads to controversial discussions. There are many different indices that attempt to measure a country’s prosperity. The most widely used is gross domestic product (GDP). It is omnipresent in everyday life, politics, and the media and appears to be the most important economic indicator. GDP is criticized primarily for its narrow focus on wealth in terms of goods and services sold on the market, and also because the indicator does not provide a comprehensive picture.\n\n3.9.1 Gross domestic product (GDP) as an indicator of prosperity\nGDP is considered the main indicator of a nation’s prosperity. It measures the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year after deducting all intermediate inputs. The concept of GDP in its current form was first developed in the 1930s – the first attempts to measure a country’s prosperity date back to the work of William Petty in the 17th century – to combat the Great Depression and plan the war economy during World War II in the US and England (Schmelzer and Vetter (2023), pp. 57-59). A prerequisite for this was the invention of the “economy” as an independent sphere of social life that can be statistically recorded and measured (Schmelzer and Vetter (2023), p. 57). Despite its widespread use today, GDP is still subject to criticism. Even economists who promoted the development of GDP warned against using it as a general measure of prosperity. Simon Kuznets, one of the most prominent economists in this field, said:\n\n“Whatever one may do with them, such numbers […] appear to be highly useful; they appear to meas-ure something clearly defined and significant, making it comparable. But upon closer inspection, the impression that such estimates are clear and unambiguous proves misleading.”\n\n\n(nach Lepenies 2013: S. 90), own translation)\n\nThe main criticism is that GDP only measures the monetary value of goods and services that have been purchased with money. The entire unpaid sector of the economy, such as unpaid care work or undeclared work, is not taken into account. GDP also says little about the actual well-being of a population, as it is reduced to purely material possessions. Furthermore, GDP neglects the social and environmental impacts of economic activities, such as social inequality and environmental pollution. Damage to the environment can even have a positive effect on GDP if, for example, after a natural disaster reconstruction has to be finance, leading to an increase in GDP. Personal accidents also increase GDP due to medical treatment, even though they represent a significant deterioration in the well-being of the person concerned. Furthermore, income distribution is not taken into account, which means that a high GDP does not necessarily reflect a fair distribution of income. In addition to these major well-known criticisms, there are several others that we will not go into further here. Finally, GDP is based on annual growth rates, which can lead to short-term thinking, with policymakers and companies pursuing short-term goals to increase GDP rather than striving for long-term sustainability goals.\nThe following chart shows the development of Switzerland’s GDP compared with selected other countries over the last 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Source: Our World in Data\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.2 Alternative indicators of prosperity\nIn view of these limitations of GDP, several alternative indicators have been developed to provide a more comprehensive picture of prosperity. One of these indicators is the Human Development Index (HDI), which takes into account not only GDP but also life expectancy and the level of education of the population. Another indicator is the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). The GPI goes one step further by attempting to include not only positive economic activities but also negative factors such as environmental pollution and social inequality in its calculations. The GPI usually consists of 26 indicators that attempt to cover the economic, social, and ecological dimensions. For example, the value of unpaid work is also included. Since it is fundamentally difficult or even impossible to measure prosperity, these indicators are also criticized for their limitations, and there are many other indicators for measuring a country’s prosperity. However, none of them have been able to establish themselves alongside GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: The diagram shows the various aspects that the GPI attempts to integrate. Source: GNHUSA.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate how widely different indicators can diverge, the calculations by Kubiszewski et al. (2013) for the development of GDP and GPI per capita since the 1950s for a group of 17 countries are shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Own illustration, based on Kubiszweski (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.3 Economic growth\nEconomic growth basically refers to the increase in a country’s economic performance or prosperity over time. As a rule, GDP growth is used as a measure of this. The central importance of economic growth for our society and economy is omnipresent in everyday life, politics, and the media. It is the central target for politics, society, and the economy, which is why Schmelzer and Vetter also refer to it as the growth paradigm (Schmelzer and Vetter (2023), pp. 62–68). Given the ubiquity of economic growth, it is surprising that it is a very recent phenomenon. It was not until the Industrial Revolution in England in the 19th century that sustained economic growth (measured in terms of GDP) was observed for the first time in the world. For most of human history, people lived without sustained economic growth. Today, economic growth is not only a central pillar of our current economic and social system, but has also become a compulsion (Binswanger 2019). We will discuss this systemic compulsion to grow and the growth paradigm in more detail later in the course. The significance of economic growth is the subject of intense debate within the sustainable economy, with widely divergent positions. While some want to hold on to economic growth (in an adapted form), others advocate overcoming economic growth as a compulsive behavior. We will examine these discussions in greater depth at a later stage.\nThe following chart shows the development of GDP per capita for various countries and regions over the last 1,000 years. The industrial revolution in the 19th century is clearly visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Own illustration, based on Kubiszweski (2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for reflection (.unnumbered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think GDP is a useful measure of a nation’s prosperity?

    "section": "4.2 Why do we need pluralist economics?",
    "text": "4.2 Why do we need pluralist economics?\nIn November 2011, dozens of students at Harvard University walked out of the introductory lecture given by Professor N. Gregory Mankiw in protest against what they saw as the politically biased presentation of economic relationships by lecturers. The students criticized Mankiw’s teaching at Harvard as being characterized by an unacceptable ideological bias that contributes to the great economic inequality in today’s society. This student protest made headlines not only because of Harvard University’s prominent position in the international academic world, but also because Gregory Mankiw is the author of an introductory textbook whose enormous influence on university education in economics has long since reached global proportions. The students also considered it particularly worthy of criticism that alternative economic approaches are practically non-existent in teaching (Harvard Political Review 2011).\nIn stark contrast to other social sciences such as sociology or political science, university education in economics today is characterized by a strong paradigmatic uniformity of teaching content. Many textbooks do not seek to acknowledge competing paradigms with different perspectives on economic relationships, but instead too often suggest to readers that there is a single economic way of thinking, neoclassical economics, which can and should be applied equally to all areas of economics—and, in principle, to all social sciences.\n\n“Indeed, I have come to the position that the economic approach is a comprehensive one that is appli-cable to all human behavior, be it behavior involving money prices or imputed shadow prices, repeated or infrequent decisions, large or minor decisions, emotional or mechanical ends, rich or poor persons, men or women, adults or children, brilliant or stupid persons, patients or therapists, businessmen or politicians, teachers or students.” - Becker, S. Gary in The Economic Approach to Human Behavior (1976), p. 8\n\nGary S. Becker received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1992 for his extension of microeconomic theory to a wide range of human behavior and human cooperation. Critics describe this extension of microeconomic theory to almost all areas of human behavior and cooperation as economic imperialism. The sometimes very one-sided textbooks in economics contribute to economic imperialism. Graupe (2015) describes economic education as an intellectual monoculture.\nTwo works are particularly significant in this context: “Economics” by Paul A. Samuelson (co-edited with William D. Nordhaus since 1985) and “Principles of Economics” by N. Gregory Mankiw. Samuelson’s textbook, first published in 1948, is considered the standard work on which all other textbooks today are based. Microeconomics in particular can be seen as an area “where the victory of Samuelson’s early pedagogy has been most complete and where the beliefs of economists have changed least” (Skousen 1997, p. 138). Mankiw’s “Principles of Economics” has become an international bestseller in recent years. This textbook by George W. Bush’s former economic advisor also occupies a central position at Swiss universities. The main criticism of standard works on economics is that concepts and the thinking underlying the models and assumptions are hardly described in concrete terms, threatening to freeze students’ perspectives into a single point of view. Students are not encouraged to reflect on the conclusions drawn in the textbooks.\n\n4.2.1 Blind spots in economics textbooks\nAfter reading Samuelson/Nordhaus or Mankiw, hardly any student will be able to say exactly how neoclassical economics thinks about “the market,” what “thinking tools” it uses to do so, and why it does so. Nevertheless, through constant repetition requiring the same type of problem-solving in varying degrees of complexity, students are led to always think in terms of price-quantity diagrams and to determine equilibrium quantities and prices, regardless of the specific task at hand. Whether the questions concern ice cream, wheat, oil, gasoline, rent, wages, steel, aluminum, education, land, or capital, the textbooks always claim that they can be solved with the help of this diagram. What is rarely questioned, however, is the existence of the underlying functional relationships themselves. Whether “supply curve,” “demand curve,” or “equilibrium price,” students learn to use these “thinking tools” to ponder everything in the world without reflecting on them themselves and without being able to question the underlying system of rules and assumptions. As explained in the section on neoclassical economics, this perspective is shaped by value judgments and worldviews. Our aim for this course on sustainable economics is to give students an insight into different thought styles in economics and enable them to identify the most common arguments in the current economic and social debate on economic growth, welfare, environmental protection, and employment. This enables students to perceive the (economic) world in a more differentiated way. After all, how we learn to perceive the world also determines what options for action we recognize and exercise in our everyday lives and as citizens.\n\n“I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” - Abraham Maslow in Psychology of Science 1966, p. 15\n\nIn the video below, Professor Ha-Joon Chang from the University of Cambridge shows the different thought styles within economics that exist and how these can lead to different economic policy programs:",

    "text": "5.2 Ecological challenges\nIn the wake of the Industrial Revolution, a uniquely productive mode of production emerged, enabling a massive increase in material prosperity. At the same time, but much less noticed, there was also a massive increase in the consumption of natural resources, environmental pollution, and emissions (Jarrige and Le Roux (2020)). Socio-economic growth went hand in hand with the acceleration of biophysical trends. The description of exponential growth dynamics is called “the great acceleration” (Steffen et al. (2015)). The graph above shows some important biophysical and socioeconomic indicators that all began to rise with the Industrial Revolution. From the middle of the 20th century, the trend toward exponential growth becomes apparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief digression: exponential growth (optional reading for interested readers)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exponential function is used to describe the size of things that are subject to accelerated growth. A crucial step is the realization that even moderate growth of, say, five percent means exponential growth, i.e., the increase becomes constantly larger (this applies, for example, to economic growth or to the number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic). Exponential growth is difficult for us humans to understand. At the beginning, it is quite slow. This is precisely why it is often greatly underestimated. However, the growth rate then increases continuously and eventually becomes enormous. An insightful value that quickly reveals growth processes is the doubling time, which can be easily calculated in your head: 70 divided by the percentage growth per unit of time. If something grows by seven percent per year, the doubling time is ten years; at five percent, it is fourteen years; and at one percent growth, it is seventy years. The number 70 is the result of multiplying 100 (the percentage value of the doubling) by the natural logarithm of 2. It is not necessary to understand how this number is derived. The only important thing is: 70 divided by the percentage growth.\nThe following thought experiment also helps to understand this better:\nA client offers you two different fees for a 64-day assignment. Which fee do you choose?\nA: You receive 10,000 CHF every day.\nB: You receive 1 cent on the first day and the amount is doubled on each subsequent day.\nThought experiment: the Payout matrix\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Planetary boundaries and the climate crisis\nSince the late 18th century, when British economist Thomas Robert Malthus first proposed a theory of overpopulation in his Essay on the Principle of Population, the discourse on planetary carrying capacity has persisted in certain scientific theories. Even though Malthus’ ideas have since been proven obsolete – he calculated the maximum population based on a fixed amount of food that could be produced – the basic idea has returned in the form of neo-Malthusianism. In the study “The Limits to Growth” published by the Club of Rome in 1972, a population limit was calculated using a neo-Malthusian approach based on the amount of food available, but also taking into account available resources, environmental pollution, and industrial output. Although the predicted developments have not materialized, the study still carries weight today from an ecological perspective that questions unlimited growth.\nThe latest theoretical development in this regard is the scientific concept of planetary boundaries. Unlike previous concepts, these do not refer to a maximum population size, but to parameters derived from Earth system science. Researchers have chosen the state of the Earth system in the Holocene as their starting point. In this era, the planet had the ideal conditions for human civilizations to emerge. Deviations from this state put humanity in an uncertain territory where tipping points can be reached. Exceeding these tipping points could either halt current developments, change their direction, or accelerate them significantly. One example of this is the extinction of many large mammals at the end of the last ice age as a result of human immigration to the American continent. The concept of planetary boundaries recommends applying the precautionary principle in order to reduce potential damage to humans and the environment. The current planetary health report uses planetary boundaries as a basic framework for evaluating the health of our planet (Ceasar et al. (2024)). In addition to the report, the recently launched Planetary Health Check initiative offers exciting opportunities on its website to explore planetary boundaries and their development over the past 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Planetary boundaries of the various subsystems and the respective risk assessment of the current status. Green indicates the safe operating space, yellow indicates increased uncertainty. Beyond yellow indicates that the risk of fatal consequences is considered high. Source: Planetary Boundaries Science (PBScience) 2025 licensed under under CC BY 4.0\n\n\n\nThe planetary boundaries refer to nine different subsystems, such as land use change and ocean acidification. An inner circle (safe operating space) and an outer circle (increased uncertainty) have been defined for each of these. Six of the nine planetary boundaries have already been exceeded. Ocean acidification is close to being exceeded, while aerosol pollution is falling slightly again. Trends in stratospheric ozone levels are pointing in slightly different directions. The degree of exceedance has in-creased for all previously identified limits (Ceasar et al. (2024)).\nWithin these nine subsystems, there are two so-called core boundaries: the integrity of the biosphere and climate change. These two systems combine the processes of many other subsystems and have an impact at the supraregional level. Reaching tipping points in these two systems can therefore cause the entire Earth system to enter a new state.\nRapid climate change in particular poses a major challenge for humanity in the 21st century. Because the energy system, transport infrastructure, and industrial agriculture are based on fossil fuels such as oil and gas, excessive greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides are continuously emitted. These accumulate in the atmosphere and prevent the sun’s heat, which enters the atmosphere through solar radiation, from escaping again (greenhouse effect). As a result, glaciers and ice sheets have shrunk, oceans have warmed, and sea levels have risen over the past 30 years. Extreme temperature anomalies and precipitation events are also increasing continuously. Today, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere is the highest it has been in the last 800,000 years, and the global average temperature has risen by more than one degree Celsius since the Indus-trial Revolution.\nIn order to avoid reaching climate tipping points, the Paris Agreement of 2015 set a target of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. The aim is to keep the average temperature rise since the Industrial Revolution “well below 2 degrees Celsius.” Even with a two-degree rise in temperature, massive biophysical changes are likely. And to achieve this goal, the energy supply must completely phase out fossil fuels by 2050. Such a transition poses major challenges for society, particularly because fossil fuels have been a key factor in the development of the current economic system and have a strong influence on its structure (see, for example, Malm (2016), Huber (2013), Kallis and Sager (2017)).",

    "section": "5.3 Social challenges",
    "text": "5.3 Social challenges\nSocial boundaries and challenges are often less clear to define. They also depend heavily on the perspective we take. Accordingly, these aspects are often discussed more controversially than, for example, planetary boundaries. The following section highlights some aspects that are central to the social dimension of sustainable development. The explanations are not exhaustive, but are intended to highlight key challenges in this dimension.\n\n5.3.1 Inequality in income and wealth\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, global poverty dominated the discussion on global social welfare, in line with the corresponding Millennium Development Goal. Although poverty still ranks first among the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), inequality has also made it onto the global agenda with SDG 10, “Reduce inequality.” The targets for this goal cover many forms of inequality, but here we focus on income and wealth inequality.\nIn the middle of the last century, US economist Simon Kuznets hypothesized that in countries with increasing economic growth, income inequality would initially rise but then decline again once a certain level was reached. The so-called “Kuznets curve” emerged during the flourishing social market economies of the 1950s and 1960s, when profits were widely distributed among workers in the growing economies of the Global North and the highest incomes were taxed at highly progressive rates. With the advent of neoliberal reforms in the 1980s, income polarization became increasingly apparent in the US and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Since then, the share of total income earned by the richest 10% has risen, while that of the bottom 50% has declined (see, for example, the World Inequality Database).\nAn important cause of rising income inequality is the changing balance of power between labor and capital in an increasingly open global economy. While a large proportion of financial capital can now be moved around the world in a fraction of a second at one click, the mobility of workers has increased relatively little. Institutional factors such as borders, but also social motivations such as family or friendships, slow down the production factor of labor. The previously established compromise between companies and employees organized in trade unions has come under pressure in many places. As a result, the wage share (proportion of earned income) is falling in many countries today, while the share of capital income is rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Elephant or hockey stick? Source: Lannen et al. 2019\n\n\n\nAt the global level, a similar picture emerges between 1988 and 2008. The curve showing relative income growth (in black) indicates that incomes in the middle percentiles of global income have risen relatively sharply. This reflects the rapid emergence of middle income groups in countries such as China and Brazil. The lowest quantiles illustrate how incomes in Africa and South Asia are growing only slowly. The trough between the richest 80 and 95 percent represents large parts of North America and Europe, where middle incomes have stagnated since the neoliberal reforms mentioned above. This representation, known as the “Milanovic elephant,” thus contains information about various phenomena simultaneously. However, when looking at absolute income growth (in red) – also known as the “hockey stick” – it becomes clear how much the incomes of the richest people have increased during this period. More than half of all income growth during this period went to the richest five percent of the world’s population. The poorer half of the world’s population received only one-tenth of the income.\nAs great as income inequality is, it pales in comparison to wealth inequality – i.e., the total value of all assets owned by a person. In his 2013 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, French economist Thomas Piketty showed how wealth inequality has grown again since the mid-20th century. He sees the main driver behind this as being that capital income has grown faster than the real economy. As a result, rich people who can invest in capital goods have access to wealth growth that is denied to working people. Waves of political liberalization following the neoliberal shift in the 1980s have also contributed to the increase in wealth inequality. Low inheritance taxes and the privatization of state-owned companies, for example, have led to wealth being concentrated in the hands of a few rich individuals.\n\n\n5.3.2 Unequal globalization\nThe economic globalization of recent decades (as well as the first wave of globalization 150 years ago) is often portrayed in a positive light, highlighting how freer international trade leads to global prosperity. However, as Milanovic noted more than 20 years ago, this obscures the other side of globalization, a side marked by exploitation and destruction (or colonialism) (Milanovic 2003). Globalization is a phenomenon of enormous magnitude and complexity and can therefore show both its beautiful and its cruel face (depending on who sees it) (Milanovic 2003). In addition to the fact that global capitalism has led to significant growth in material prosperity in many places, an increase in inequality has also been observed, as explained above. Furthermore, the economic system in many places was based on colonial and imperial violence. To this day, these structures lead to exploitation, dependencies, and unequal exchange in many places (see, for example, Chang (2002), Anievas and Nişancioğlu (2015), Davis (2017), Ghosh (2021), Hickel (2017)).\nFIGURE\nFigure xy shows that high-income countries consume more resources, land, energy, and labor than they produce themselves. In this respect, there is an unequal exchange between the different country groups. In addition, the globalized world economy and the corresponding institutions are pushing many countries in the Global South into the production of raw materials (see, for example, Palma (2003)). At the same time, many countries are active in highly specialized industries and services, where more value can be extracted. Global value chains are often controlled by companies in the Global North, which reinforces this unequal exchange and enables these companies to skim off the lion’s share of the profits and shift the costs to the Global South (see, for example, Carballa Smichowski, Durand, and Knauss (2021), (althouseEcologicallyUnequalExchange20233?), Durand and Milberg (2020), Ponte (2022)). Such constellations increase pressure on working conditions and favor exploitative relationships in the Global South.\nThis is only a small and simplified excerpt from the complexity of the globalized economy. Many aspects are still insufficiently researched and controversially discussed. However, the main point here is to show that, as Milanovic argues, globalization has at least two faces. Which one it shows must be examined case by case.\n\n\n5.3.3 Social acceleration\nAs the graphs by Steffen et al. (2015) show under ecological challenges, not only have earth system trends accelerated rapidly in the 20th century, but so have socio-economic trends. Hartmut Rosa describes modernization as a process of “social acceleration” (see, for example, Rosa (2003), Rosa 2024). According to Rosa, technological progress is accompanied by accelerating social change (e.g., changes in social relationship patterns) and an increasing pace of life. These acceleration processes are driven by economic, cultural, and structural factors and lead us to feel increasingly pressed for time and stressed, despite constant technological progress and the associated efficiency gains. For example, enormous advances in communication technologies have enabled us to communicate much more efficiently over long distances (e.g., emails instead of letters). Where we used to write a few letters at most, the number of emails sent has increased massively, and we fill the time freed up by sending additional emails, which in turn brings with it further obligations and changes relationship patterns. This has increased the possibilities and requirements for availability, for example. Technological progress is also accelerating the possibilities for experiencing parts of the world (e.g., through advances in transportation and communication). The world we can potentially experience is expanding faster than the proportion we can actually experience. In relative terms, therefore, the proportion of the world we can experience is shrinking. Such acceleration dynamics have an impact on the social well-being of individuals and societies and cannot therefore be ignored.",

    "section": "5.4 Economic challenges",
    "text": "5.4 Economic challenges\nThe economic interrelationships and the associated problems and boundaries are also complex and less clearly visible and illustrative than, for example, planetary boundaries. Nevertheless, there are economic interrelationships that promote crises and limit the scope for action. Some of these interrelationships will be briefly outlined below. However, these explanations are by no means exhaustive.\n\n5.4.1 Growth dependency\nThe current capitalist economic system is structurally dependent on growth. This means that a decline in economic activity in the form of stagnation, recession, or even depression would lead to an economic crisis with far-reaching consequences for the population (e.g., unemployment, impoverishment, cuts in social services) (Schmelzer and Vetter (2019), p. 26). If growth fails to materialize, the system enters a crisis. There is either growth or contraction, but nothing in between. Matthias Binswanger shows that this compulsion to grow is rooted in market competition (Binswanger (2019)). Companies that do not make a profit are forced out of the market. If the average profit across the entire economy is negative, a corresponding number of companies are forced out of the market, which can lead to a downward spiral. Furthermore, the system contains many growth drivers that structurally increase growth dependency (e.g., technological progress, interest rate system, corporate forms, etc.). Many political and social institutions are also heavily dependent on growth (e.g., social security systems are largely financed by paid work, making full employment and growth central aspects of its financing). Hartmut Rosa shows, for example, that culture in the Global North also functions strongly as a driver of growth and is based on acceleration (Rosa (2003)).\nThe concrete effects of growth, for example on society and the environment, are also controversial in some respects and are reflected in the debate between green growth and post-growth (we will examine this debate in more detail in section 5 and 6). The key point here, however, is that dependence on growth severely limits the scope for action. Accordingly, there are many approaches that primarily seek to reduce the system’s dependence on growth.\n\n\n5.4.2 Financialization and financial crises\nBefore 2008, influential representatives of economics were so confident that they believed they had found instruments for crisis-free management of market economies. It was believed that recessions and, above all, depressions could be avoided. The causes of previous crises were said to be inefficient government regulations and interventions. These had prevented the rationality of individual market participants from leading to the market equilibrium. The extensive deregulation of financial markets was thought to have created self-regulating mechanisms for economic stabilization. This made the 2008 banking crisis all the more surprising to most economists. Their belief in the rationality of markets proved to be a mistake when the bankruptcy of the prestigious Lehman Brothers bank in September 2008 led to a panic on the stock markets. The idea that financial markets function efficiently and can be deregulated accordingly (based on Eugene Fama’s market efficiency hypothesis (1970) and in the tradition of neoclassical economics) was confronted with reality. It became apparent that post-Keynesian theories, for example, which point to the possibilities of inherent instabilities in the system, are carrying important and valid insights. In particular, the work of Hyman Minsky (1992) received renewed attention, as he emphasized the inherent instability of the financial system in his financial instability hypothesis. The worst effects of the financial crises were prevented because politicians and experts had learned from the experiences of the Great Depression following the global crisis in 1929: governments and central banks immediately took over the function of stabilizing the system (ideas that go back to the theories of John Maynard Keynes).\nThe basic economic function of the financial sector is to provide loans to finance investments (mostly by companies). The regulation of the financial sector is intended to ensure that the financial industry primarily fulfills this function in the best possible way. The strict financial market regulation that followed the stock market crash of 1929 was an essential foundation of welfare capitalism, in which activities in the real economy (production in factories, retail, large infrastructure projects, etc.) were at the center of economic life. Starting in the 1980s, financial market regulations were gradually dismantled. This strengthened financial market interests with their business model of exploiting price changes for internationally traded assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives, etc.) to generate profits. New technological possibilities were exploited, such as high-frequency trading, in which high-performance computers use pre-programmed algorithms to react to the smallest price changes within microseconds and buy or sell assets.\nThis shift in economic dynamics and power to the financial sector is called financialization. A power complex emerged in the financial sector, consisting of central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions, private pension funds, and the owners of large and small fortunes associated with them. Through financialization, financial markets grow disproportionately to the real economy, which has been made possible by national deregulation measures – exactly in line with the development observed by Thomas Piketty (see chapter Social challenges).\nTwin Peak Paradox: Debt Crisis and Inequality\nIn recent years, the link between income and wealth distribution and the accumulation of debt has come increasingly into focus. Rising income and wealth inequality can contribute to trade imbalances. This is the case, for example, when individual countries either stimulate the weakening of mass purchasing power with credit-financed private demand for consumption (US and UK) or attempt to compensate for low domestic demand with rising export surpluses (Germany, China, and Japan). Furthermore, increasing inequality and growing indebtedness are closely connected. Economists at the International Monetary Fund (Kumhof and Rancière (2010)), for example, argue that rising inequality leads to increasing borrowing among the lower and middle classes to sustain their consumption levels, while the richest individuals have limited capacity to spend it on consumption (e.g. you can have only so many yachts). Therefore, they invest their money in the financial sector, which gives out loans to the lower and middle classes. Furthermore, this contributes to the dynamics of financialization outlined above. In this video, Yanis Varoufakis describes the current situation of high debt and great inequality as a twin peak paradox.\n\n\n\n\nAnievas, Alexander, and Kerem Nişancioğlu. 2015.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 6.1: The three sustainability strategies; our own representation\n\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Efficiency strategy\nThe efficiency strategy aims to use fewer resources (raw materials and energy) than before in the manufacture of products or the provision of services without reducing the quantity produced. This includes minimizing material use (material intensity) and energy use (energy intensity) as well as emissions of harmful substances such as CO2. This concept is often referred to as eco-efficiency and is considered promising in business and society because it can reduce costs, resource consumption, and environmental pollution. The efficiency strategy focuses on the production side, where change is primarily sought through technological advances. Proponents of this approach believe that it is possible to double prosperity while halving the consumption of natural resources (Weizsäcker et al. 1997). Critics of the efficiency strategy are less optimistic, however, and warn against overestimating its impact on sustainable economic activity. They point to so-called rebound effects, which can lead to the gains from efficiency improvements being reduced or even offset (Paech 2012; Santarius 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of efficiency strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy-efficient lighting: Replacing conventional light bulbs with energy-efficient LED lamps re-duces electricity consumption and helps to lower energy requirements.\nFuel-efficient vehicles: The development of hybrid or electric vehicles with improved fuel con-sumption reduces fuel demand and emissions from traffic.\nEfficient building technology: Installing smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in buildings helps reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling.\nEfficient water use: The use of water-saving systems in households and industrial companies reduces water consumption and minimizes waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Consistency strategy\nWhile the efficiency strategy is quantity-oriented – less resource consumption with more output – the consistency strategy strives for compatibility between nature and technology, with the goal of reusing resources instead of consuming them only once. This implies replacing materials, products, and technologies that are often based on fossil resources with those that are compatible with natural material cycles and run in harmony with natural processes (Pufé 2017). This is often referred to as eco-effectiveness and follows the “cradle to cradle” principle, whereby products go from “cradle to cradle” instead of “cradle to grave.” The idea behind this is that in intelligent systems, there is no waste, only products. This can be achieved in two ways: materials can either be biodegradable, as in shampoo without synthetic ingredients, or they can be designed as “technical nutrients” that remain in the technical cycle. This means that a product that has reached the end of its useful life does not end up in the trash, but is transferred to the next cycle of use, for example by being upcycled. For example, a computer case could be reused over and over again or converted into a shelving system. The consistency strategy also focuses on the production side. This strategy is expected to offer greater problem-solving potential, a wider reach, and more profound changes than the efficiency strategy.\nNevertheless, material cycles in the economy are not feasible without mass and energy losses, so absolute consistency remains an unattainable ideal. Even 100% biodegradable products consume energy in their manufacture. Nevertheless, consistency is seen as an impetus for industry to strive for this ideal and to reduce both resource consumption and emissions as far as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of consistency strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable energy systems: The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power ensures that energy production is in harmony with the natural rhythms and cycles of the environment.\nRecyclable electronics: Electronic devices are designed to be easy to repair, upgrade, and recycle in order to minimize resource consumption and environmental impact.\nSustainable construction: Buildings are constructed using sustainable materials that have a low environmental impact and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Sufficiency strategy\n“Sufficiency” questions the extent of what is needed for a good life and aims to reduce resource and energy consumption by lowering demand for resource-intensive goods and services. Sufficiency is often translated as contentment, frugality or moderation. It takes a critical look at the new needs created by technology and advertising in relation to limited natural resources. Sufficiency promotes an understanding of not chasing every newly created need and to satisfy needs without commercial consumption. Unlike efficiency and consistency, sufficiency focuses on consumption, but not exclusively: sufficiency can be practiced to varying degrees and at different levels, from minor behavioural changes (sharing instead of buying) to significant lifestyle changes (giving up air travel). Although it starts at the individual level, sufficiency can be applied at various levels, including businesses (sufficiency-oriented product design) and governments (sufficiency policy). Sufficiency therefore asks about the right amount: How much do we need for a good life? And what do we not need? The sufficiency strategy is the subject of passionate and intense debate (Sedláček 2012).\nCritics consider the sufficiency strategy to be limited in terms of its savings potential and socio-cultural resonance. They doubt that it can gain broad acceptance in the population. Proponents, on the other hand, believe that the sufficiency strategy has an essential place in sustainability policy, especially where efficiency and consistency strategies reach their limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of sufficiency strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing and communal use: Platforms and initiatives for sharing items, tools, or vehicles enable resources to be used more efficiently and reduce the number of products manufactured.\nPlant-based diet: Switching to a predominantly plant-based diet reduces the demand for re-sources such as water and land compared to meat production.\nShorter working hours: Reducing working hours can lead to lower resource use, as less energy and materials are needed to produce goods and services.\nLocal consumption: Supporting local producers and markets helps reduce transport distances and emissions.",

    "text": "6.2 Economic policy paradigms\nIn order to achieve the sustainability goals, measures based on the three sustainability strategies must be implemented. How the goals are achieved, i.e., which combination of strategies is pursued, and which measures are implemented, is largely determined by the underlying mindsets and worldviews. However, these mindsets do not exist in isolation in the economic policy discourse. Rather, many economic policy approaches are simultaneously shaped by different thought styles. Following Novy et al. (2023), we distinguish between three basic economic policy paradigms that emerge from the influences of different thought styles (see Figure 29) and their scientific concepts: the liberal market paradigm, the welfare capitalist paradigm, and the post-growth paradigm. The economic policy paradigms and their understanding of sustainability, which underlie the different approaches, determine to a considerable extent their orientation and their mix of strategies and policies.\n\n6.2.1 Liberal market liberal paradigm\nThe main goal of the liberal market paradigm is to protect individual freedoms as much as possible and minimize government intervention, especially in the form of bans and market restrictions. This framework mainly promotes negative freedoms and relies on a comprehensive market order that protects and enforces property and contract rights as well as competition. The idea is that almost all areas of the economy, including basic services, should be organized according to market principles. This is intended to enable both the maximum development of individual freedoms and the efficient use of limited resources.\nThe liberal market paradigm argues that market regulation is more efficient than state intervention, even in areas such as environmental protection or the setting of minimum wages. Although it is recognized that in a complex, interconnected society, completely free markets, global trade, companies, and consumers can never be fully realized, the idea of self-regulating markets serves as a guideline for economic policy decisions. Such a market order should ensure that companies and consumers can make individual decisions as freely and independently as possible. This requires not only state enforcement of a liberal market order, but also technology neutrality.\nThe goal of the liberal market paradigm is thus to protect individual freedoms while ensuring that markets remain as free as possible from state intervention and neutral with regard to technology.\n\n\n6.2.2 Welfare capitalist paradigm\nThe main goal of the welfare capitalist paradigm is to ensure and protect material prosperity. This approach attempts to combine competitive economic measures with social justice and, in green variants, with environmental protection. Based on the successes of the 20th century, it is argued that promoting the capitalist economic system is compatible with a good life for all.\nThis has been achieved in part through the establishment of welfare states, which have largely solved social problems such as poverty and unemployment by providing basic services—at least in many wealthy countries. The hope is that a similar approach can also help to overcome the ecological challenges. The goal is to ensure a secure material standard of living by increasing production and incomes while reducing resource consumption and emissions.\nSimilar to the liberal market paradigm, green growth also plays a central role in the welfare capitalist approach. This is intended to enable win-win situations and avoid social tensions.\n\n\n6.2.3 The post-growth paradigm\nThe main goal of the post-growth paradigm is a fulfilling life in a sustainable society that exists in harmony with nature. To achieve this, it is necessary to overcome the compulsion for constant economic growth in the capitalist system. The aim is to replace the existing exploitative relationship between humans and nature with one in which humans are seen as part of an ecological system.\nIn order to preserve the foundations of life, the post-growth paradigm strives for an economy that remains in a stable state (steady-state economy) or can function independently of economic growth and ensures the basic provision of human needs. A central principle here is sufficiency, which means finding the right amount of resource use. This may mean using fewer resources in some areas to reduce environmental impacts.\nThe post-growth paradigm recognizes that not all economic sectors need to grow and that contraction in some areas does not necessarily represent a loss. The role of the state in this approach is controversial, as state actors often maintain unsustainable conditions, but are at the same time important actors to establish sustainable frameworks. The emphasis is more on global cooperation and a stronger role for civil society in reshaping society “from below.”\nThese economic policy paradigm – market liberalism, welfare capitalism, and post-growth – represent different views on how society should respond to pressing issues in the field of environmental protection and sustainability. They reflect how policymakers and societies at the global level are trying to stay within planetary boundaries and achieve climate goals. Since these guiding frameworks are based on scientific concepts of different schools of thought, they are strongly influenced by scientific debate. On the other hand, these models also shape scientific debate, since economics is not free from normative influences, as we discussed in section 1.\nIn the next section, we will explore various approaches to sustainable economics. We will draw on these guiding paradigm, focusing in particular on the post-growth paradigm and, to a lesser extent, on green growth approaches within the welfare capitalist paradigm. In line with the different influences of these schools of thought on the frameworks, we will also have to consider the various economic theories and approaches of pluralist economics. These theories offer different perspectives on the challenges and goals of sustainable economics and shape the three paradigms. Below is an overview of how these schools of thought influence the three paradigms– market liberalism, welfare capitalism, and post-growth. This overview should enable us to better understand the many facets of the sustainability debate and develop approaches that can meet the requirements of a more sustainable future. However, these classifications are not set in stone and may vary depending on the specific point of view and context. Some schools of thought may also fall completely outside the three guiding paradigms. In pluralist economics, there are a variety of approaches and theories that can shed light on different aspects of economic and societal design. Combining and integrating these different perspectives can lead to a more comprehensive understanding and approach to promoting sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Our own representation based on the illustration of Exploring Economics",

    "text": "6.5 Weak sustainability – position of neoclassical economics[1]\nWeak sustainability represents a rather “lenient” requirement for sustainability. For proponents of this view, an action is sustainable if it offers an overall benefit to the system as a whole or at least does not reduce its quality. Weak sustainability can therefore be seen as a kind of basic requirement for sustainability, with the aim of maintaining a certain level of well-being/quality of life or ensuring equality. The concept of weak sustainability “assumes the extensive and, at least in principle, unlimited […] substitutability of all types of capital” (Ott and Döring 2004: 41, own translation) and is thus based on the premise of neoclassical economics. For example, natural capital can be replaced by other types of capital; the loss of biodiversity could be replaced by technological capital. It is assumed that it is ultimately irrelevant in what physical form the inherited capital stock is passed on to the next generation – the only thing that matters is that the total capital and total utility, and thus the overall level of welfare, are maintained. The concept of weak sustainability ties in with neoclassical utility theory, according to which it is irrelevant how utility is generated. Environmental economics, which emerged from neoclassical economics, fundamentally draws on the concept of weak sustainability.\nWithin the framework of the concept of weak sustainability, a measure can still be considered sustainable even if it is at the expense of natural capital. This is the case, for example, if the loss is offset by an increase in human or physical capital. The extraction of raw materials such as coal or excessive crude oil production could therefore be perfectly justifiable. This understanding tends to recognize the strong role of technological progress in sustainable development. Evaluating measures based on such a concept is inherently complex, as it always involves many assumptions. Apart from fundamental questions about sustainability such as “What is a good life? How do you measure the level of prosperity?”, the value of different types of capital must also be determined. This is because an important prerequisite for substitutability is that the different types of capital are comparable, which in practice means that everything must be assigned a monetary value. Even where there is no market price, a monetary value must therefore be determined. As early as 1974, William Kapp doubted whether this monetary valuation could reflect the substantial social value that is actually at stake (Kapp 1974). In addition, fundamental and normative questions arise when it comes to operationalization. Which factors are taken into account? What is the value of natural beauty? What is the value of a rare bird or a whale? This short video gives some insight into these discussions.\nCriticism of the concept of weak sustainability therefore includes questions about the unlimited substitutability of natural resources by reproducible capital. There are also doubts as to whether more goods can compensate for the loss of environmental quality. Finally, there is uncertainty about the development of resources and critical thresholds. The consequence of this criticism is the concept of strong sustainability.\nStrong sustainability – the position of ecological economics\nIn contrast to weak sustainability, the position of strong sustainability considers the value of natural capital to be irreplaceable. Characteristic of the proponents of strong sustainability is that their optimism regarding individual substitution possibilities is much lower. They therefore emphasize the importance of an intact natural capital stock. They consider it inconceivable that the natural capital stock could be drastically reduced in favor of another type of capital. Human-produced capital and natural capital are only interchangeable to a limited extent. Proponents of strong sustainability thus take an ecocentric view, in contrast to the anthropocentric view of weak sustainability.\nIn contrast to the confidence of neoclassical economists regarding substitutability, proponents of strong sustainability do not believe in solutions based on aftercare and reaction, but rather focus on prevention and anticipation. For example, the increase in the ozone hole can only be compensated to a limited extent by measures such as sunscreen, protective clothing, and medical aftercare. Even technological approaches such as geoengineering are viewed critically, as they treat the problem superficially rather than addressing its causes. Geoengineering refers to technical interventions in geochemical or biogeochemical cycles, for example to slow down climate change or ocean acidification.\nUntil now, reducing environmental pollution has mainly focused on end-of-pipe technologies, such as catalytic converters in cars. At the same time, long-term environmental problems have been pushed into the background by such measures as long as their effects have not been clearly perceived, as in the case of climate change or biodiversity loss. This seemingly environmental protection is explained by the concept of externalization, in which environmental and social costs are shifted to external parties, as described, for example, by Lessenich (2020). This means that only economic and business costs are taken into account in pricing, partly because these are easier to quantify, while the social and environmental costs of providing goods and services are omitted or shifted to external parties. This leads to distortions in market prices.\n[1] Excerpt from Pufé 2017, starting on page 105, and https://thesustainablepeople.com/starke-und-schwache-nachhaltigkeit/\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Comparison of weak and strong sustainability (Pufé 2017:109)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweak sustainability\nstrong sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\nhuman-centered perspective (anthropo-centrism)\nbased on neoclassical economics\nassumes harmony between growth and the environment\nsubstitutability of natural capital\ngrowth paradigm, growth is central\noptimistic about the potential for continued growth\n\nstrategy: rely on technological efficiency, economic growth and market mechanism\nconventional cost-benefit analysis as primary decision-making tool\n\nnature-centered perspective (ecocentrism)\nbased on ecological economics\nconflict between growth and environment\nno substitutability of natural capital\nimpossibility of infinite growth\nsceptical about continued growth\n\nstrategy: stop/limit growth, ethical restraint and efficiency at both personal and political levels\nsees traditional cost-benefit analysis as inadequate for sustainability issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs already mentioned at the beginning, the polar positions of sustainable economics, green growth, and post-growth are based on different understandings of sustainability, are supported by scientific concepts of different schools of thought and are accordingly oriented toward different economic policy frameworks.

    "section": "6.3 Green growth and post-growth",
    "text": "6.3 Green growth and post-growth\nThe two central scientific concepts that shape the debates on sustainable economics as polar positions and can be located in these approaches: green growth and post-growth[1] .\nGreen growth, as proposed  by the OECD (2011) and the World Bank (2012), is an approach that sees green economic growth as a solution to ecological challenges. This approach pursues the idea that it is possible to grow the economy while minimizing environmental impacts. In our view, this approach can be derived primarily from the welfare capitalist framework and, to a lesser extent, from the liberal market framework. \nThis contrasts with post-growth approaches advocated by researchers such as Jackson (2009), Seidl and Zahrnt (2010), van den Bergh (2011) and D’Alisa et al. (2016), which are derived from the post-growth model. These approaches argue that economic growth, especially as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), and the associated compulsion to grow are the root causes of ecological problems. They point out that numerous analyses of the current economic and social system show that economic growth is unlikely to be a solution in the current system. This view is based on the recognition that modern capitalist democracies often depend on permanent increases in profits and productivity in order to stabilize themselves (Binswanger 2019; Lessenich 2020; Rosa 2016), as we have explained under economic challenges.\nThe underlying disagreement between these polar positions lies in one of the most central questions of sustainable economics: Should we focus on green economic growth to achieve ecological goals, or is it necessary to rethink the existing economic system and its focus on growth? In the following section, we will explore these concepts and views in greater depth in order to develop a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the field of environmental and sustainability policy.\n[1] The term degrowth is also frequently used. Although the two terms are not entirely synonymous, they largely overlap. For the sake of simplicity, we will therefore use the term post-growth in each case. In our view, the strength of the term post-growth lies primarily in the fact that it does not emphasize a possible contraction of the economy, but rather the necessary independence from growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: adapted from Petschow et al. (2018: 22)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n### Further reading\nIf you are interested, you can watch the statement by Paolo Gentiloni (European Commissioner for Economy) at the Beyond Growth conference to illustrate the green growth position. The post-growth position is well illustrated in a contribution by Timothée Parrique at the same conference.",
