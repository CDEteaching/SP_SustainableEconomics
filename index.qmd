# Preface {.unnumbered}

*Version 1.0, October 2025*

This e-learning course is intended for students to work through it at their own pace. There are no sessions held in presence. However, students can reach out to the lecturer for questions and support at any time via email. The course is structured along six sections that build on each other. Many sections are interactive and contain links and videos to consult. For more information on the course please see the information document of the course.

The course is divided into three blocks. In the introductory block, students are introduced to basic concepts and the theoretical assumptions of economics (Section 1-4). This is followed by a block on the problem analysis addressing the ecological, social, and economic challenges faced by the current economic and societal system (Section 5). In the final block, participants explore various building blocks that provide starting points for shaping a sustainable economy (Section 6-7).

Below you will find the contents of the course. Following the script will guide you through all the sections and learning material in a sensible order. Since this course requires a high degree of autonomy in acquiring the material, we also encourage you to contact us via email if you want to discuss questions (see information document).

Students can:

-   understand that there are different theories in economics and are able to name them.

-   are able to critically question both traditional and new economic approaches (concepts) and assess the conflicts inherent in them.
-   can reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical approaches, both in general and in relation to concrete problems.
-   can analyse how alternative economic models (e.g., circular economy, post-growth economics) function and evaluate their potential and limitations for economic policy.
-   acquire basic knowledge about measures and transformation scenarios for implementing alternative economic models beyond the focus on maximizing profits and goods production.
